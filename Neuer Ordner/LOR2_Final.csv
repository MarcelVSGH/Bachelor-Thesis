Worst writing on modern TV,"The writing and directing in this show is just absolutely horrible.Why would the people leave a fortified place to fight orcs in an open village?Why does arondir shoot his bow like that?Why does brownwyn lead the humans when she was just a healer before and human elf relationships are looked down upon?Why do the people from numenor suddenly love galadriel, what has she done to deserve it and why is she leading after acting like a spoiled teenager the last 5 episodes?Why make Theo burn his own mother when anyone else could have done it and why does everyone else watch instead of preparing for the orcs that are on their doorstep?Why does galdriel keep adar alive just for torture when it will clearly turn out to be a bad choice?Because f you thats why. Such poor writing its insultingAlso the fake suspense building is just horrible directing. For example when arondir has boss battle orc about to stab him I was 100% sure that brownwyn would save him, it made the scene very stupid even before it happened. Also when browywyn got shot with an arrow I was also completely certain she would live. Then yet again when theo gives them the sword. It was very obvious that the Numenors that were shown galloping 3 minutes before this would somehow find the village just in time to save the characters with plot Armour because Adar for some reason didnt kill them right away This doesnt build suspense, just takes you out of the show even more.And every little bit of diaogue is so corny it hurts.One can not satisfy thirst by drinking sea water really galadriel? Bad acting and writing merged to birth this monstrosity of a fanfiction character.I could keep nitpicking but I think I will spend my time watching something that the writers arent trying to insult my intelligence.Tune in next week to see how galadriel and friends survive a volcano!",fireandblood-46400,1,0.5013623978201635,Yes,Udûn,184,367
Tolkien turned over in his grave.,"You killed Celeborn? Really? What now, are you guys going to get galadriel and Halbrand married? From now on, this storyline has expired for me. You didnt read the books I can understand that. But didnt you looked to the family tree charts. Have can Celeborn died. Will you say that Celeborn is not dead, he is aliveeeee later. Wonderful script, wonderful show. This would be a perfect example of plot twist. I mean woow. Okay we accepted that Galadriel is full of anger and passion of revenge. And she is a 5000 years old teenager. She is taking advices from Amazon-created Miriel who is more clever than one of the mightiest elf (Galadriel).Whatever, it was a really great episode, thank you for all of your efforts for this episode. Especially production crew made a wonderful job. But script writers, I dont wanna say anything to you.:D.",onatmf,1,0.6592592592592592,Yes,The Eye,89,135
dont like having to do singular reviews after doing a general one but this needs it,"In my general review for this, I explained how the series had shown what it is within the first 2 episodes and after this I realised that what I thought was the worst was actually the heights of creativity that existed in the people behind this....questionable idea, because it got worse and worse and worse as it went along.So brace yourselves, we have spoilers coming in and imdb the tag is up as of this second. Here we go.I argued with people that the eruption of the volcano in the previous episode was not Mt Doom as the topography of Middle Earth would make no sense if it was, that established lore in the appendices of LOTR tells what happened within the land where shadows dwell. To give as small of a briefing as I can, it was forged in the First Age by Morgoth and was his central home, he led the assault on all of Middle-Earth from there and yes, even the Mountain of Fire was there in the First Age.So that argument is wrong right off that the Southlands is Modor.Then of course theres the fact that Mordor is in the East and not the South, as the Enemy is in the East is why the cry of the Men of the West was used by the Free Peoples against Sauron in the 3rd Age.The decisions and ideas shown by characters throughout this has been terrible, from homicidal harfoots to now regicidal Dwarf Princesses. And all of this is before the influence of the Rings of Power that twist and heighten the negative traits of all the Races when they use them (its heavily implied that the reason the Dwarves of Dwarrowdelf became obsessed with Mithril is because of one of the 7 Dwarven Rings of Power that made them far greedier) so heaven help people when that corruption starts acting up.Everything about this series is a travesty and a nightmare, nothing is worth it and it harms everyone involved in various ways.",HardLight,1,0.6,Yes,The Eye,66,110
So bad...,"Had this show been based on a new unproved universe with a B-budget, then sure.. It would have gone down as an forgettable adventure series worthy of about 6-7 stars, however...Bearing in mind that this is the most expensive tv-show ever and is based on the much loved and well-developed universe of Tolkien, it is just so painfully done. The writing is dull, the characters are dull. The CGI-effects are beautiful, but when it comes to the movie props, even these are off.It is truely a shame that they seem to have spend all the budget on CGI-effects and left nothing for the writers or getting a proper cast of actors.On the plus side though. It really makes us appreciate House of Dragons even more...",anders-skrivermoeller,1,0.6176470588235294,No,The Eye,42,68
Worst episode so far,"One episode away from the finale this is the absolute low point of the series so far.The dialogues are so bad I cringed several times and then you dont know if you should laugh at or weep at all the wasted effort and budget.Its pathetic how they try to keep it interesting and maintain an air of mystery by just omitting things or not explaining them.The acting - or the actors - are not even mediocre.Through episode 7 there is not a single character that has succeeded to form a bond with me ad a viewer and worst of all, nobody shows a even a spark of charisma.Its all just a big harassment of Tolkiens legacy bit without the spirit.",stef2000,1,0.6875,No,The Eye,11,16
"Plot armor, no tension, nothing of importance","The writters made a conscious choice to make the burst from the volcano deadly for the village of the south were our main cast is. Nothing make them do it, its far from the mountain, so the volcanic explosion might not reached their place, but they chose to, they showed how the blast impacted with such force that it was capable to tear down walls and put things to fire.After that scene, seems that none of the heroes was actually injured by it, despite not seeking for shelter when the blast hit them. A couple of random villagers was gravelly wounded and other characters receive some injuries from fires, but thats it. We now have complete confirmation that our characters have huge plot armor. We are also teased yet again with the death of Browyn, after been tesed with deaths like that at least 4 times in the previous episode. Gets really boring.The volcanic eruption also reaches the non-hobbit fella, but it does in a funny way, you only see craters where the fruit trees were, and the characters seems to be unaware of the eruption, so it seems that they did not see huge boulders of fire rock flying in the direction.We also got to enjoy how the writters keeps stealing things from Peter Jackson movies, like manflesh line, or horses that goes to save fallen Numenoreans.",luisq05,1,0.7272727272727273,Yes,The Eye,8,11
Disaster!,"The most dissapointed series of about lord of the rings. You cannot be more disrecpectful to tolkien. After this series tolkien wont be able to rest in peace aynmore. We saw galadriel was searcing the miriel,halbrand and elendil in a little village! But after that scene she left the town even not searching for them! More funny things about this episode they came with horses to the town and got back to the military camp even shortest time than they came to town on the horses. Another thing is how the queen got blind! She was able to see at beginnig of the episode but how come she got blind later in this episode?",aliyugokmen-91007,1,0.55,Yes,The Eye,22,40
A pointless experience,"Well, now that I have seen the full furst season, I warn you: if youre a Tolkien fan, dont bother. They alter events, create different sotires without purpose. They specifically bought a story with a big fan base so as to utilize it economically without respecting what made the story wonderful: detail, attention, love and respect for its characters.On the other hand, if youre just a fan of fantasy shows: there really are many better ones. The writing lacks pacing and characters are built either like mary sues or incoherent plot enabling people, with whom the audience cant really click.All in all, it is disturbing that so many are trying to save this by recommending with what seem rather political stances, rather than positions based on the quality of the product (which should be what attracted us to this) not the case, its been politicized. What a shame of a show (pun intended).",tinuvielson,1,0.7142857142857143,No,The Eye,5,7
"I will say, I have laughed a lot.","I have never, never in my life flipped my mindset about a show in order to get through episodes, so this is a first.I dont know what happened in this episode and the last, but I have started laughing out loud at some of the scenes as they almost literally, pop my mind.The Volcano, the fire, the survivors, the dumb, dumb logic of leaving them all screaming for help. I now laugh at these strange decisions as they appear on screen. There is drama or suspense any more, only audible laughs as each dumb moment, each failing quote presents itself and then disappears.What a shame that such incredible source material must be reduced to this.So bad, I have cancelled Prime.",chrisjones0,1,0.5555555555555556,No,The Eye,5,9
What are you doing guys?,"Seriously. What are you doing guys?Why is Elrond walking Moria about 7 episodes? Where is Cerebrimbor? Hobbits all scenes are so boring enough for Stranger scenes. We do not want to know who is Sauron or who is Stranger anymore. You can not make a strange ambiance like Lost or etc.Galadriel is a horrible character. Please change her dialogue. She is like a teenage girl.Adar? Who is he? Yes, we understood half orc/half elf but please just explain in detail. You can not do a mystery series. Mordor scene was so cringe.Please fire these guys and make a new plan. This show is horrible. Just horrible.",the_nsk33,1,0.6,Yes,The Eye,3,5
1.2.3 gone ?,"This show has nothing to do with the works of Tolkien, nay it completely disregards them and goes against them. Writing is awful, dialogues are bleak and cheesy af, bordering on nonsense. Casting and acting is bad just plain bad. Show just tries to make easy profit and get instant global audience by slapping names from Tolkiens beloved works on showrunners own original characters and story. Wanna see Galadriel we love from Tolkiens world? Elrond? Celebrimbor? Gil-Galad? You simply cant because they do not exist in this show, there are completely fundamentaly different characters who just happen to have same name and vague outward resemblance to Tolkiens characters.",vincdujardin,1,0.4444444444444444,No,Adrift,4,9
No logic whatsoever,"This episode is the lowest point in terms of logic.Towers held together with a single rope. Abandoning a castle to defend an open village. Orcs forgetting battering ram at home while assaulting castle, but bringing it for a tavern assaulting. Hiding the magic key under the floorboard. Numenorians galloping from their first step on soil until they magically teleport into a battle just in time. No one bothers to check the package with an extreme importance. That package is given to the stupid teenager, for what?Nearly every single action, dialogue and character are just laughable, what a shame.",ozguncirakman,1,0.8333333333333334,Yes,Udûn,5,6
Declined?,"First 10 minutes is the best of the series but they acted like the story had advanced to that point. At least the Elf gave a rousing speech.The fact they said a village was a defensible position, which looked like it was in a valley with zero walls or defenses, which is ridiculous. They had the tower. An Orc attacked the elf and did the I got you so I throw you away Got you again and threw you away again Got you, throw you away. No one fights like that.Time lines dont match.Horses charge to the village which looked like it is in a valley from the sea? These south lands are a long journey inland right or are these people coastal without thew ships? They have GPS satellites, makes no sense. Also pretty sure armor shouldnt be plastic.",carlstar-87626,1,0.5769230769230769,Yes,Udûn,15,26
I couldnt believe my eyes!,"Some short parts of the episode seemed to make it get a little better, but it sank again and again after a few seconds. The first really easily won battle between humans (helped by one elf) and orcs was hilarious. Reminiscent of Peter Jacksons fall of the tower in The Return of the King, this one made no sense... Was an entire stone tower secured by some ropes?The second battle is supposed to cause some surprise by the arrival of the army commanded by Galadriel?... or Elendil?... or the Regent Queen of Númenor? After the battle, this last one is introduced to the people as the Regent Queen... they must have wondered which kingdom it was! Why should they have known? They didnt even expect this saving army! Both stories were disconnected until that point and, why did the whole army go directly to that village in the first place?!Scenes of the tavern made into an improvised keep (with almost everything made of wood, really easy to make burn) and the arrival of the army show different times of the day: from the windows you could see it was night for the people inside the keep, but the sun was shining for the army arriving and, God, no, it was no meant symbolically! Symbolism is way ahead for the showrunners of this extremely absurd plot!And then, a guy who was no-one until Galadriel decided he should get the crown of the Southlands because she realized he was carrying some seal which made him the heir... is acclaimed as the king! These people have just seen him but accept him as the promised king. A guy who could just be a thief, who for sure has some skills as a smith and killed one orc! How brave a king!The whole Isil story is another nonsense: he does not know what he wants, but ends up fighting for the Southlands and even gets some recognition for just appearing in the battle -and, well, yes, helping his father Elendil getting up from the floor. And his companions are portrayed (including himself) as silly teenagers who appear to care more about hanging out together than anything else.How the orcs father takes care of them makes the audience more sympathetic with him than with the good guys or the harfoot who leave aside those who cannot keep on the road (a very Darwinian community for sure)... but, really, who are the good ones? Rambo-Galadriel? Her good intentions are questioned by many along the series to the point that she cannot be distinguished from the evil she allegedly fights against. Or is she just fighting for revenge and causing a lot of ruin around as a result of her loss (her brother´s death)?And the end? Water causing a volcano explosion which is seen from far away by a shocked Galadriel while approaching her in a setting that reminds of the terrible bad scene by Anne Heche in Volcano... Maybe Anne Heche was an elf and had that penetrating sight sense enabling her to find one person among hundreds running from destruction and we have just discovered it. Thank you RoP!And, by the way, where are the rings of power? Please, give us some hint after 6 awful episodes!I wasnt expecting a comedy, but this is what RoP turned out to be.",avaninaneyra,1,0.4805194805194805,Yes,Udûn,37,77
What was this ?,Time Travelling from Numenor. How they get there within a day. That makes no sense at all. And how does the bakery lady become a warlord leader of the southlands in a couple of a days time. And now the series should be over after all was hit by a pyroclastic flow. No way to survive that at all. All should be turned to ashes like in Pompeii. If they are still alive in the next episode after taking that hit. It will be the worst writing in the history of television. Its a fantasy show i get that but everything about this show screams lazy and even bad writing. There is no logic in this series. They should just add John Wick and let him clean up all the orcs and be done with the series. Not following any source material anyways.Nice visuals though.,rickardbjorn-johansson,1,0.44155844155844154,Yes,Udûn,34,77
Boring,"Boring. Its hard to watch, because its just boring. Theres something wrong with all these reviews. You have no emotional attachment with the characters, the acting is bad, script is completly predictable ... I dont understand how this show is a 6.9. Okay that 1 is too low. Maybe a 5 just because of the landscape. But thats just it: some landscapes are nice. Im only still watching because (1) my husband makes me watch it and (2) because of all the expectations that was built on this. And dont get me wrong. Im a huge fan of Lotr, game of thrones, house of dragons, and so on. I think Amazon got ripped off. Just sad.",vjaniszewski,1,0.3870967741935484,No,Udûn,60,155
Its the last episode I forced myself to watch,"Im so done with this nonsensical nothing-burger show.Numenorians reaching Middle-Earth in two minutes, no sense of time and space. They teleport themselves where the humans inexplicably decided to defend a tavern because apparently the fortified tower they had wasnt good enough (I guess King Theoden can learn something from them. Why take the people to Helms Deep when you can die faster and easier at Edoras?)
Galadriel un-ironically lecturing Isil (not Isildur) about humility and then side-saddling TWICE just in case you didnt realise the firs time how tough she is. Orcs exploding before the swords even touched them and more sad death scenes about people we dont even care about. What writer what have this nonsensical show on his resume? The only good thing about this episode was that we didnt see Harfoots and dwarves.",Flak36,1,0.4117647058823529,Yes,Udûn,35,85
Worst episode yet,"And here we go, the moment they added some action this serie went form bad to worse. Absolutly unfaithfull of the original material, thw whole adar story line is dragged and unnecessary. There are SO manu things that happens during the second era and they decided to made up new things that dont work. Thw worse part is the characters development. Galadriel in primis is the most cringe protagonista one could ever imagined. Horrible acting and a characters that has nothing in common with the Galadriel talkien wrote about.Even the action sequences does not pay.

Clunky and lightweight dialougue,"Dear me. Where to start?Firstly, what is good? The visual set pieces and some decent actors.What is bad? Just about everything.The dialogue is laughably bad and attempting to create tolkien-esque writing which it fails at miserably. Conversations are left at awkward end points with no resolution as the writers attempt to write profound quotes, often using immediate contradictions.All characters that are introduced are devoid of love and life and instead come across as 2 dimensional. It is hard to be endeared to anyone in this show.I am, as a LOTR fan, already feeling like Hobbits and Gandalf are not needed in this show.What a shame.",chrisjones0,1,0.6666666666666666,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,3
Nothing Tolkien but the name.,"If a visually stunning show or generic feeling fantasy is what youre looking for, this will be right up your alley. If youre looking for another Tolkien adventure into Middle Earth, this misses the mark entirely. The characters are nothing like written in the books and have all been reinvented. Not for the better. The Hobbits are awkward. The Elves are way to into politics and the humans are bland. The Dwarfs almost had something going for them, but are used as comedic relief. Plot is rushed with only a few minute explanation of why were at the point we are in the story.Do better Amazon. Do better by J. R. R.

"I didnt have a lot of expectations, and somehow...","I didnt have a lot of expectations this was going to be LOTR good, or that it would live up to the hype. Honestly was incredibly disappointed by Episode 1 and wont be continuing further.What made this world great was the characters, their interactions, and the limitless world. By myopia takes over this attempt by Amazon to build a new world.Character arcs are incredibly important, and you need more than eye popping scenery to build a world, especially one based upon Unfinished tales and the appendices. These did not have dialogue and didnt have a lot more beyond facts and places. Fleshing out the characters was priority 1 and this failed miserably in that attempt.",higherquality-44082,1,0.375,No,A Shadow of the Past,12,32
How NOT to Write a Screenplay,"Who wrote this garbage?? I never thought I would be bored by Middle earth, but this series succeeded in doing just that. The screenplay is poorly structured and very weird at many parts. At one point Galadriel insults Elrond - out of nowhere. The reason she insults him is even more hilarious: for trying to hit on her a few seconds prior. What made it worse than the fact this is all manufactured, is that no such flirting was even shown on screen. So the viewer is left wondering, did i just miss something! The show is filled with many moments like this. Is it just bad scripting or bad editing? Maybe both? Either way the whole show feels like some cheap CW teen drama.",dracharon,1,0.4375,No,A Shadow of the Past,7,16
Im Glad Tolkien Or Christopher T Are Not Here To See This Adcraptation,"Say what you want about Peter Jacksons Lord Of The Rings &amp; Hobbit adaptations. He at least stuck to Tolkiens messaging and language throughout the six films.For the most expensive show ever created, this is a complete joke. Out of all of the law, stories, myths and incredible creations that came of out Tolkiens mind, you chose to start the show with a young girl, who by the way was royalty, getting bullied by lesser elves.Out of all the things I have watched in my life the most pointless monologue of all has to go to Finrod comparing boats to stones. Absolutely ridiculous. There was literally an infinite number of ways you could have started the show with a bang and you chose the worst possible one with extremely high definition but dull scenes that vaguely in a boring way explained the 1st age. The trees of Valinor were just kind of faded away. You could have had a huge dark spider sucking them dry LIKE THE BOOK. Even that one small tweak would have made the first 10 minutes of your show more exciting.I have no issue with new character or minority actors playing characters, more the merrier. But for the love of god make the characters interesting and give them a good opening!Galadriels character has been completely made up by people in 2022 who cant even dream of having the talent of JRR Tolkien. There are none who can! Its not their fault. But what is their fault is deciding to make stuff up and change beloved characters personalities, wants and desires.I honestly never thought that I would be wanting Galadriel to get squashed by a troll. The character they have created is the most unlikable character I have seen in years.Poor. Very Poor.With the choice of GOT or Witcher I wont be continuing with Ring Of Power.As a life long Tolkien fan. I will also be cancelling my prime account.As someone who has done most of my shopping on Amazon for the past 4 years. I will be supporting businesses locally or just finding products elsewhere.They really messed it up.",mjallen-87627,1,0.4375,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,7,16
Very slow,"I was really looking forward to this show, more than many other shows that have been advertised this Autumn. Unfortunately, this episode was very slow, the CGI that everyone is raving about looks like a video game and there are plenty of shows with POC in lead roles for me to watch so theres nothing special here. I like female-led shows, but so far I have zero interest in Galadriel and Elanor Nori Brandyfoot -who have a lot of screen-time. I have watched this episode twice so far, the firtst time I needed a coffee and I had to remind myself to stop looking at t my phone.

Unbelievably badly written,"Ill not write so much, because its not worth it.Crazy battles in which a character comes from one site to save the day when he was actually at the opposite side before. Nonsense.Volcano eruption with cold ashes. Do you have any idea of the temperature volcanic ashes like that reach? Thousands of degrees F. Even if they get colder along they way they would absolutely burn everybodys skins and lungs. But... important characters cant die, right?Harfoots are horrible and evil!!! If your foot is broken, we leave you behind. If some problem coms up in the forest, we find someone to blame and basically sentence them to death. Isnt it supposed to be a tribe? Dont tribes exist to support its members? Why would anyone be part of a tribe which does not care for the wounded? This writing makes absolutely no sense.",jonasarjunior,1,0.6956521739130435,Yes,The Eye,48,69
Painfully Boring,"I am writing this from the perspective of someone who has only seen the movies. Yes Ive read the books, but I recognize most causually wathcing this havent read LotR let alone the Similrilian, so taking that perspective wont matter to most. To be blunt, There is just too much dialogue. From Galadriels never ending 17-minute naration and intro, to every side character needing to have a line, the show just never lets up on the exposition. Amazon needs to learn how to show, not tell. Which is sad because this is a SHOW not an Audiobook. Yet its like the creators are scared to go a full 15 seconds without someone talking becuase they know their audience will lose interest. The only action scene we get is about 5 seocnds with Galadriel killing a troll and thats it. The rest is just boring dialogue between far too many characters to keep track of.I perosnally cannot stand this Galadriels accent. While this chick does look somewhat like a younger Cate Blanchett, why not find a skinny blonde that also sounds like her, or at least have Blanchett dub over her? Blanchett set the image of Galadirel toughout both the LotR trilogy AND the Hobbit Trilogy, so it seems very odd that suddenly Gladariel now has a french/swedish accent. Does she just magically lose her accent by the Third Age/Hobbit movies?Likewise, Elrond just doesnt look like Elrond. I do not understand why the show didnt bother to cast someone that resembled a younger Hugo Weaving. Its as if the creators are trying their damndest to pretend the prior movies didnt exist and hope we are too stupid to remember them.Then theres Morgoth, or rather the lack their off. The entire setting of events is based of Morgoths reign and wars on Middle Earth as well as his evil that still lingers, yet he barely gets a mention. The intro does a very poor job of explaining who Morgoth was or why we should care, instead trying to shift the focus on Sauron. And yet, throughout this episode and the next, there are regular callbacks to Morgoth and the 1st Age such as the Silmarils and Feanor. The show wants us to fear Morogoth and see him as the great evil threat, but how can we fear him if we never see him nor the damage he does beyond one tree being destoryed? Contrast that from the 5 minute intro of Fellowship of the Ring where we see Saurons army fighting the Last Alliance of Men and Elves, we see Sauron tall, dark and powerful giving us a face to associate all the evil in Middle Earth with, and we see his defeat setting the stage for the rest of the movies. How hard would it be for Rings of Power to do that with Morgoth?I think they shouldve dedicated the 1st episode to Morogth and the War between his forces lead by Sauron vs the Elves/Valor. It wouldve done such a more impactful job for us to understand why Morgoth is the supreme bad guy, why we should also fear Sauron, why the elves had to fight, and the toll the war had. But most importantly, it would set the stage for why Galadriel is so wary and refuses to return to Valinor like the the rest of her Elves do.",ShadowsBeneathTheLight,1,0.55,No,A Shadow of the Past,11,20
A Terrible beginning to a tepid idea.,"A Shadow of the past.Lets look at this opening. Elf children running about like human children, being mean? I dont recall elves even thinking such until Feanor drew his sword on his half brother. Whats with these haircuts? They look like they just came out of Supercuts. And everyone running around in gossamer robes like they were angels or something? Morfydd Clark. Where did the casting directors find her? Unemotional and unitone. At least they mentioned Morgoth-who the elves knew as Melkor until Feanor renamed him Morgoth, the great enemy of the world. They didnt all sail. Feanor burned the ships he stole at the kinslaying. Nice shot of the end of the Great War of the jewels (which got a mention!) They left out that, in the early battles, the elves swept through the orcs like they didnt exist. Galadriel was never mentioned as a warrior-not once. She didnt believe the Eldar could defeat Morgoth and took no part in the wars of the first age. She did become close with Melian, Thingols wife and learned wisdom from her. She wasnt a captain of any army and there was no army of the north, unless you count Angband, under Sauron. Describing her in a footnote as an Amazon, doesnt make her an Amazon. Fingolfin gave his life to save Beren. This isnt mentioned. His body was never recovered. Also, Galadriel would have obeyed Gil-Galad, the last High-Elven king in middle-earth. Galadriel never hunted Sauron. Galadriels strength came from knowledge and from having seen the light of the two trees since she was born in Valinor. This is left out. NOWHERE is she mentioned as a WARRIOR. NOWHERE. She took no part in the kinslaying, marching across the ice of the frozen north back to Middle-Earth. Where is Celeborn? Galadriel had little interaction with men, other than the survivors of Numenor and, later, the Dunedain. This isnt the Elrond from the books, who was born IN THE FIRST AGE, and is called Half-Elven because he is a descendant, with his brother, of Earendil. Elros chose to be mortal, and be the first king of Numenor, Elros Tar-Minyataur. But thats left out as well. Galadriel is entirely brave, her male companions are cowards and buffoons. Commander of the Northern armies? Warrior of the Wasteland? Who wrote this drek. And, while Numenor exists, Sauron is off in Mordor, plotting. He can still appear fair and wont lose this ability until the destruction of that land. Whats all this Harfoots nonsense? Hobbits (who shouldnt even be in this as they played no part in the second age), are descended from the Fallohides, Harfoots and Stoors. Or were the writers simple minds too small to recall this? Galadriel chose to remain in middle-earth after the war of wrath and, with Celeborn, founded Laurellindorian, later known as Lorien. And Elrond, by the second age is wise, and he grew up with the evil Galdriel claims he didnt grow up with. WRONG. His father is Earendil, who with a Silmaril upon his brow, reached the blessed realm and got the Valar to come defeat Morgoth. Guess making Galadriel a super-warrior was more important than Elrond being the loremaster he is in the books. Ooops. Elrond and Galadriel are friends eh? Theyre also relatives since shes his MOTHER IN LAW. Making her a warrior was a ridiculous idea. Men enslaved by Elves? Where the hell did this absolutely, untrue, stupid idea come from? From being high? Elves and Men wed only three times in all of Middle-Earths history. THREE TIMES. No other relationships. No torrid affairs, NONE. Another ridiculous idea. Oh, did I mention that the first episode was boring as hell? BORING. And the men who followed Morgoth, the Easterlings, those who werent killed, returned east. Hobbits arent even mentioned in the Chronology until the third age when two brothers found the shire. And why are these harfoots so untidy? Hobbits arent bums. So, Galadriel (Morfydd Clark needs to go back to acting school) comes back from almost reaching Aman as a meteor? Im really gagging now.

"I dont expect much from this show, but... (Commenting on ep1/2)","Please, writers, when you do comment on something that IS in Tolkiens known writings, please be accurate. Please. Its really annoying to watch when you get basics wrong.Finrod Felagund did not vow to hunt Sauron down, and was not killed while doing so. Finrod was captured by Sauron while assisting Beren in his quest to wrest a Silmaril from Morgoths crown, and was then killed in a dungeon by a warewolf. So... Galadriels opening remarks are both inaccurate and really annoying. Yes, you could argue it was all part of the war (obviously due to copyright the produces have Galadriel lumping the entire events of the fulirst age into one war), but still ... not accurate. Galadriel I did not mind overall but - where is Celeborn? If he was in her life (which he was) from the first age, why did he have no influence on her decisions, either to stay and fight or go into the West? I guess, according to this adaption, they are estranged at this point.Also, I hate the short haired, old looking elves. Gil-galad, Elrond and Celebrimbor all look fusty - not elven, not like warriors, and not wise. Celebrimbor is downright weedy. Also, their attitude towards the possible return of the shadow was un-elven. Some of the elves came off as whiny cowards. Actually, generally, there were a lot of whiny characters in this episode. Characters were either gung-ho adventurers or else whiny scared and annoying.Now to men: ugh. Seriously annoying accents. We get it. Outside of Numenor, men are dirty, backwards elf haters. Not one likeable character there. Even Bronwyn was kind of annoying. And her relationship with an elf... Sigh. Please. Over done already dont you think? Must there be an impossible/frowned on relationship in every tolkien-esque adaption? Not original, precious. Not original at all.I did love the music. Very Tolkien-esque. Also the effects are fantastic.Overall though, the pacing was off. Either too fast through big scenes, or too slow when it came to certain characters. I.e. Why did we have to spend soooo long with Harfoots. I dont mind having Hobbits in the show - I mean they mustve been around somewhere in middle-earth during the second age - but aside from Nori, they came off a little annoying, especially Noris sidekick friend.Meteor man is interesting. Hes obviously a good guy, possibly one of the Maier sent to help. Lets hope he can learn to talk before the season ends.Halbrand is interesting and mysterious. I think hes definitely a villan, or will become one.The Dwarves and the Khazadum scenery were awesome. However - its doubtful that Elrond was ever so close with prince Durin. Galadriel and Celebrimbor loved the Dwarves due to their shared love of creating things from metals and gems, but Elrond? Again... sigh. I guess if its not mentioned the producers have decided they can put it in. So I foresee many more forays off-lore with additions.Arondir is an ok character. Still - long hair wouldve made him more elven.I think that covers my opinion so far.Im hoping in future episodes the characters improve and grow on me. Well see.",mickenrach-61172,1,0.5569620253164557,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,44,79
What an awful show,"The first episode felt like it took three hours to play out. An episode where nothing really happens and these idiot characters played by apalling actors with terrible lines just wander about for no reason and no script direction. The build up has been better than the end result for this show.In fact! Rather than what I have just watched! I would have rather watched the story they skipped over in the first 6 minutes of the episode. The north of the elves, sailing to middle earth! Fighting Morgoth and then defeating them (none of which appeared on screen) Then Morgoth was defeated, once again not on screen. Sauron then took the lead, but as powerful as he was decided to disappear! Then hundreds of years passed as Galadriel searched for Sauron! That would have been a great episode or even first season.But no the highly intelligent writers skipped over the best part of the show with a couple of clips and a voiceover... skipping hundreds of years and a great story idea in 8 mins or less.Then skip to elves struggling up a mountain. Elves dont struggle they run and skip and jump! Do the writers of this show actually know anything about these characters. What a way to burn more than £50 million per episode or whatever it breaks down to!!",Lokii321,1,0.6551724137931034,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,19,29
It looks expensive,"The visuals are very nice, but that is all good i can say.Story is boring, characters are unlikeable and the dialogue is really bad.I was zero invested in anything and this is supposed to be the pilot of a series, i surely wont continue watching.I guarantee that this wont last the promised 5 seasons, i cant see many people liking this and it already shows.My girlfriend fell asleep while watching and she is a lord of the rings fan.It tries also very hard to be like game of thrones yet it fails completely in doing so.So much money wasted and i feel bad for the actors.They are already deleting reviews and covering up that this series is a huge fail.I started The Boys instead.Thanks but no thanks, i am out.",LouZephyr,1,0.5700934579439252,No,A Shadow of the Past,61,107
"Worst writing ever, nice cinematography","I really dont know how did the rights (some of them) of this amazing legendarium got to the hands of the writers of Rings of Power. Who do they bribe?! How can this be possible?! Nothing makes sense and most certainly nothing is Tolkien like.Millions of dollars wasted in what? Only the visuals?Because if i give 1 star is only for that, cant imagine being in the mind of the people that give this show 9 or 10 stars, this episode was the worst, by far!Amazon should ve got Andy Serkis to read what they get the rights of and no more, that would ve been 10000 times better than this money wasting machine!Man im angry! You even made me write a review!

Worst episode so far,"CGI was not on par with earlier episodes, and it was entirely elf/human centric, which for me has been the worst parts of the show so far. More dwarves and hobbits please.Like many have said before, this series feels like fan fiction, and this episode has been the worst of them. Isildur is on a ship, decides to feed an apple to horse, lets it take one bite, then decided to take two bites out of it himself, then goes topside and throws the remaining apple into the sea. It was the most bizarre, pointless, and poorly written series of events in the show thus far. His reason for moving topside could have been nothing more than wanting to see the water, or any other of a number of reasons to move him could have played out. Using his want to discard a half eaten apple by throwing it into the sea, was this shows writing at its most terrible.Nothing happens throughout the entire episode other than fighting and cowering. The plot did not move forward in the least, until the last minute where the dam was broken, unleashing water into the magma chambers of the volcano causing it to erupt and cover the town in ash. I guess we shall see where the next episode takes us. I cant imagine a way that it could be any worse than this last one.",jony-sea,1,0.391304347826087,Yes,Udûn,9,23
Mediocre,"I dont think this show deserves any 10/10 or 1/10 ratings. The show is mediocre. If it did not involve the Lord of the Rings brand then nobody would be talking about it.It seems like the show creators devoted all of their time and money towards spectacle (and yes, the show DOES look nice), neglecting what really matters: good storytelling. The audience is not given any reason to care about the characters. There is nothing that hooked me in and made me want to watch more. The pacing and editing is all over the place. I was honestly mostly bored by the first two episodes. The dialogue is clumsy and on-the-nose. Sure, there are some decent action scenes, but this is not the main appeal of LOTR. The LOTR film trilogy succeeded not only because of its action but because of its emotional depth and how well the characters were developed.Compare the troll fight in Rings of Power to the troll fight in Fellowship. In Fellowship the characters have to give it their all to defeat the troll. Frodo almost dies. The characters are visibly exhausted physically and emotionally. They rush to Frodo and are relieved that he survived. Now look at the troll fight in Rings of Power. One character effortlessly kills the troll in 10 seconds. Some nameless companions are hurt beforehand (or possibly killed?) but nobody seems to care or mind. But I guess people eat this stuff up because it looks cool.Is it fair to judge Rings of Power after only 2 episodes? Absolutely. We are already 2 hours in. I was completely on board and invested in Fellowship of the Ring far before the 2 hour mark...",gckator,1,0.5625,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,18,32
Not worthy.,"Now that I have seen the full furst season, I warn you: if youre a Tolkien fan, dont bother. They alter events, create different sotires without purpose.If youre just a fan of fantasy shows: there really are many better ones. The writing lacks pacing and characters are built either like mary sues or incoherent plot enabling people, with whom the audience cant really click.All in all, it is disturbing that so many are trying to save this by recommending with what seem rather political stances, rather than positions based kn the quality of the product (which should be what attracted us to this) not the case, its been politicized. What a shame of a show (pun intended).",tinuvielson,1,0.6666666666666666,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,3
Badly written scenes,"1-how everyboy survived from volcanic eruption, we saw literally everyting was burning, houses, grounds barn, everything. But people survived?2-Why galadriel and Teo immediately left the town without helping the others
3-Why miriel told to elendil nobody should see that i am blind because after few scenes, she wraped a bandage to her eyes so everybody can see that she is blind.4-How halbrand got up? He was dying in his bad, he was so bad that he needs elf medicine even but suddenly he got up ride horse, probably like 2 weeks maybe more? How?5-Again Nearly all the lines was very bad written, i believe writers thought that they were cool :D6-Again there is no time feeling in this serial, how many day weeks past or hour past.",vinclause,1,0.9285714285714286,No,The Eye,13,14
Its not Tolkiens world,"As a Tolkien world fan who has read his books times, to me, it does not feel like middle earth at all. It reminds me more of Narnia or even the witcher! The chosen actors are really unappropriated for their roles and their characteristics have changed a lot compared to the book. The illustrations do not feel like what I read in books and as a Tolkien fan, I can not accept it as a series representing middle earth. The books had details enough to illustrate and it did not need this much change and going away from the book and story and involving the modern world policy in the show! From my point of view, in the best way, It is fanfiction of middle earth and does not deserve to be titled with a masterpiece name like the lord of the rings!I had been waiting for a show of this amazing world almost for a decade as there were rumours about it.

Who is paying for this script?,"I simply cant understand how is it possible to invest so much in such a bad story. Who is hiring those writers? Does anyone read the full script before production?I wasnt expecting this show to be at LOTR level, but seriously how is it possible to come up with such a weak script for such a hyped show...The first episode was fine, the second was meh, but since the 3rd the dialogues are so bad, or meaningless, that makes you wonder why are you still watching it.

Just take that conversation of Galadriel in the cells. It feels like a soap opera. That fight scene in the cells was unrealistic.Its sooooo booooring! That conversation with the queen of Numenor. Why should I care? What are they talking about?The scene where they are fleeing from the orcs is not good either. The music tries to make us feel something that is not properly set up. The show did not set up those characters. So I dont care if they die.Whats happening in Numenor? What is that speech at the end? What is she talking about! The show doesnt explain! There is majestic music but I dont feel majestic. Why is the queen going together with Galadriel back? Isnt that a bad idea? Shouldnt she send another person? An ambassador? Why the queen?

"It keeps getting worse, yes that is possible.","Well theyve thrown lore out the window since Elendir, Isildur, and Miriel were born about 1600 years after the one ring was forged. Not to mention two Durins alive at the same time, when they are reincarnations of each other. Isildur never having a sister. Hobbits are now evil creatures that leave their kin to die should they fall behind. Why this need for speed? An extra day on their migration so that no one is left behind is going to kill them? Are they like flying south for the winter or something? Who is chasing them? If these same hobbits are so keen to stay hidden, why are they using well trodden roads to travel? Nothing makes sense in this show. Sauron should have already made his nine, seven, three, and one rings, killed Celebrimbor, destroyed Eregion, recovered all his rings but the elven three and one dawrven ring, laid siege to Rivendell, and Lindon, and been driven back to Mordor as a result, by the intervention of Numenor. Sauron then had 1400 odd years in Mordor rebuilting his strength, bringing forth his Nazgul(all nine), ALL THIS BEFORE any of these Numenorians we see in this episode were born.So all that pesky sticking to the lore, and always going back to the book, back to the book stuff was just nonsense to placate fans backlash. Theyve shredded Tolkiens work, thrown it in the toilet, along with a billion dollars, ate Chipotle, then sat on the toilet and let their loose watery stool write a script.

Breaking Canon,"There are so many problems with this episode, its difficult to know where to start.The most glaring is the appearance of Míriel, Ar-Pharazôn, Elendil and Isildur.Isildur was born in 3209 of the Second Age. The titular Rings of Power were forged in the year 1500, and the One Ring in 1600.If Galadriel really did go to Númenor and meet Elendil, then shed already been given one of the Elven rings, Nenya and then hidden it way back in the year 1693.Assuming there are multiple timelines in this story, this would still mean that Galadriel already knows where Sauron is and what hes up to.This is an unforgivable re-imagining of the Second Age that we were promised wouldnt happen.The other thing that I find disturbing in this, and previous episodes is that Galadriel, who must be at least 3900 years old by the time she meets Elendil in the series, behaves like a spoilt, entitled teenager. This is in stark contrast to how shes depicted in Peter Jacksons LoTR films, where shes calm, collected, wise and thoughtful in choosing her words.",escott-robert,1,0.0,No,Adar,0,3
Galadriel is unbearable,"Who knew they could make her character worse than the first two episodes? She makes me want to root for the orcs.Who thought this was a good idea? She is constantly nagging.

Although, the only reason I am watching is to see how bad this actually gets. And its looking like this is a bottomless pit.How did it come this?

The sea is always right,It truly amazes me that this show is getting any good reviews at all wether or not you are a massive tolkien fan or not.This show is utterly unfathomable.So many things to go on in this episode at how terrible a show this truly is.Galadriel has to be the most annoying characters to be on screen and her exchange with the queen regent was absolutely cringeworthy.We got to see isildur aswell along with captain cook on a journey somewhere and the sea is always right. What on earth is that dialoge?The sea is always right? This show is about as close to a tolkien story as an episode of eastenders or tellytubbies.

Its as if they put together a team of people all trying to make the worst show possible. Like you need to put in a tremendous amount of effort by many people with one goal in mind, to make the worst show ever seen.Then, since that was the first episode, you have to top that by making an even worse show for the second episode.

I cant believe that amazon waste a large amount of monet for this series. Tolkien must be sad for what happend to his masterpiece.

Getting better but still off the mark,"Ill start with saying this episode was very visually appealing; however, that cant help with the poor writing. The story and dialog are so far removed from Tolkien its hardly recognize. Galadriel is annoying and Arondir is just kind of flat. The most intriguing character so far is Elendil. He seems the closest so far to how Tolkien wrote him, which should tell the writers that they need to go back to the books if they want to be successful. The character Halbrand (even though not an original character) also has promise. There is something intriguing about the mystery of his past.

This show is anything but Tolkien,"This is an infant show, I will not say its completely bad, maybe it could be nice for a child, but its not what I expected, and on each episode it gets worse. Now I understand all the criticism, Im very sad about the wasted potential. Lets hope they fix it at some point. Some scenes are stunning, very few combats are well made. All dialogues are awful, the characters are so shallow, its so different than Tolkiens books. And we cant avoid compare to House of Dragons, where everything seems much more credible. And why there are so many inutile scenes? So many scenes doesnt add nothing to the story, seems they have a one page story and they are trying to transforms it into a 10 seasons show.",brunogaquino,1,0.45,No,Adar,45,100
Id rather poke my eyes out with forks,"More characters, which is fine if youre given a reason to care about them.However that was done for by the minimal story line advances, tedious scenes of pointless chat about minute points and then over explained plot points where there was any intrigue.The sumptuous scenery and photography is just making the lack of any coherent or interesting narrative more obvious.And good god did I ever think Id see galadriel comparing symbols on maps like Mikey in The Goonies making the whole Mordor thing so easily revealed so early in such a cheese manner.It felt like the whole episode was designed to try and make you forget that NOTHING INTERESTING IS REALLY HAPPENING.",groverjon,1,0.4782608695652174,Yes,Adar,55,115

So Elendil is a ship captain,"Where do I even begin? Bad script? Bad dialogue?

Dwarfs? Orcs? Cause we are no nearer to the forging of the rings and the characters are so bland, especially Elendil and Isildur which we know from the books.Why is Galadriel so bad? Why is she so angsty and short in statue? And what was with the slow motion riding scene? She is thousands of years old, she rode a horse before, why was that scene so important thst you had to film it in slow motion?This is bad even for generic fan fiction, not to mention how bad is for Tolkien fans.Elendil a ship captain?

Weakest episode so far,"Lets start with the good part. The only good part of the episode for me are the aesthetics and world design of Numenor and its inhabitants. Elendil and Isildur are the most interesting characters in the show so far along with King Durin and Prince Durin. They are setting up Isildurs sister an original character btw to be the founder of Gondor and Anor, thats why she was approved in the builders guild and that is cringe. Galadriel is by far the worst most toxic, unlikable character in the show, queen Miriel is meh and Halbrand is interesting despite that i know what his role is in the show. The Harfoots scenes are the worst part of the show , i literal almost fell asleep in their scenes during this episode. And the Arondil scenes although the character is not bad by any means his story arc is. 20 minutes to show a 5 min top progression on a pit. And by the way the name of the episode is Adar and we dont even see him only as a blurry image or hear him talk.

While I was having that snack, I forgot that I was watching this show.Then I got excited about re-watching the last episode of House of the Dragon, so I returned to the tv, only to realize that I hadnt finished watching this episode of Rings of Power.Ah, this crap wasnt over, I mumbled, as I pressed the play button and reluctantly watched the episode to the end.So, needless to say, the episode is surprisingly boring.",Tudor_A,1,0.5178571428571429,No,The Great Wave,29,56
Galadriel is just terrible....,"Galadriel may be one of the most unlikeable main characters I have seen in a long time. Shes my favorite character in the books too. The fact that in the books she was someone who could make men weep with just a glance, but here in the show mortal men compare her to children or an angry horse just says it all. She doesnt even accomplish her goals. This episode can be summarized as Galadriel has temper tantrum all over Numenor, gets her way because leaves fall off tree. Writing equally bad in other places.... Evil Elf lets Arondir go for.....reasons. And lets him keep his bow and arrows? What? Overall the problem is that I just dont find myself caring for any characters outside of the dwarf plot, and thats the least important of the plots at the moment (besides not-hobbits and meteor hobbo).",jmallen-76149,1,0.3870967741935484,Yes,The Great Wave,12,31

That sword has been reproduced tens of thousands of times, it is is many posters, pictures and figures and your show COULD NOT GET IT RIGHT. Black Grip forward and Silver Back. Not just Narsil but even when the Blade was reforged to Anduril, the Guard back to the Pummel remained the same. Who the heck do you have doing basic continuity checks? Clearly someone who cannot do the job!Then I had to laugh, yes laugh at the gift of Mithril, to Elrond. Hey guess what we all see the Evenstar Necklace being made from it.That acting is Horrible.

Unfaithful adaptation and insult to Tolkiens legacy,"Theyve alienated the fans by their statements and created something they wanted to create, instead of making a faithful adaptation to the lore. The characters are not in situations authentic to the lore, and modern sensitivities have crept into the work. One can clearly see the difference between the great deal of respect that Peter Jackson had for Tolkiens work versus these showrunners who disregarded what made this fictional world so endearing to generations of fans from all over the world.This is why the trailers are getting ratioed and the response to this show has been overwhelmingly negative by actual fans.The heart of the philosophy of Tolkien is missing from this show, and the people who made it would literally hate Tolkien were he alive today.",dmjrnbsn-30762,1,0.5,No,Adrift,4,8
It only can be Sauron,"The second episode of Rings of Power takes the foundations built in episode 1 and, much like Elrond and Durin smashing rocks, destroys it. The tone in this show is so wildly inconsistent that its a wonder you wont get whiplash from this.The first episode was essentially dark and serious, with Galadriel determined to see her mission through no mater what, no matter who dies along the way. Which makes her remark at the end to Halbrand, unhappy that hed let his companions die, all the more deliciously ironic. And of course, Galadriel is still very unlikable in this chapter with zero flaws, which is an alarming trend in modern entertainment.But again ,that tone I mentioned is the biggest deterrent to episode 2. We get a lot of slapstick here, including Durin and Disas banter and Noris slapstick with the makeshift carriage flying backwards down a hill. But then this is juxtaposed against an absolutely brutal fight involving Bronwyn and that orc, which is hung, beaten and then eventually decapitated. I do appreciate the original LOTR trilogy mixed humour with action too but here it just doesnt gel very well.Hopefully things do improve but given how much money has been poured into this one, pretty visuals and production design can only get you so far. However the ending hints that weve got lots more drama to come going forward so well have to wait and see what episode 3 has in store for us.",elessarelbenstein,1,0.6,Yes,Adrift,3,5

There goes your folklore in drain,"Dwarves women dont have beards according to Lord of the Ring - Ring of Power. What were the directors thinking? If you guys are remaking one of the best franchise, at least have a decency to honor its folklore. Even witcher has dwarves women with facial hair. They completely ruined this franchise for me. Making a folklore to adapt to modern world standard is stupid. Its not worth it to watch and spend your energy if they dont care. Please dont watch this show if you are a Tolkien head. Only good thing about this show are visual and music. Story and folklore which is what makes LOTR so great is dead.",har-har-mahadev,1,0.5454545454545454,No,Adrift,6,11
"Why, Why, Why.","How could these show writers make the decision to not stay faithful to the source material. The most successful fantasy writer of all time with a story series that has enamoured people across the world and they have decided that they could do better.This show feels so depressing and hopeless that it becomes a slog to even try and finish an episode. I am already convinced that I will not be watching series 2. I will re-watch the Hobbit trilogy instead.Continuity and in-world logic seem to be unimportant in the creation of this show and the lack of appreciation for the geography is a real shame. Watching adventurous travel in the LOTR trilogy was a joy and embedded the viewer in the world. In this show, it is treated as an inconvenience.Some of the choices to change the established characters and lore is mind-boggling.Awful, awful writing.",chrisjones0,1,0.8333333333333334,No,Adrift,5,6

Time Is Precious,"People are busy, life is hard. So to produce something where nothing happens in an hour is quite frankly really astounding to me.I dont understand why the only people feared dead are the people we know CANNOT be dead because they are in Lord of The Rings.I was excited for this show for years, ever since it was announced. I would search for titbits online throughout the years to see what was going on because I was so excited for more Middle Earth content. To be honest, what we have given just makes me sad. You can seriously tell that not a single person on the writing team cares about the story or the world.Visual effects are faultless (apart from the silly font change for Morder) I mean seriously? It looked like a power point presentation. and now on the next slide, you will see ladies and gentlemen that it is in fact Morder, DUN DUN DUNNN!Durin wanted to dig for Mithril, his dad said no, he dug anyway, his dad caught him, his dad said no, he dug again, his dad caught him again. 58 million dollars..... 58....million.... dollars.Galadriel is clearly suffering from dual personality disorder because in the previous episode she was a raging racist genocidal maniac and in this episode shes telling Theo not to talk about wanting to kill orcs.The writing is so lazy you can see it on screen which is a first for me. They needed Halbrand to go with Galadriel so he was mortally wounded and only Elvish medicine would make him better. So we see him walking to his horse for a long ride perfectly fine! He could have just slept it off!How about Halbrand agrees to tell his tale to Gil Galad because the king has lost faith in Galadriel, boom, better reason, took me 30 seconds to think of.There is a real problem here, this show is forgettable. Its going to take another 2 years for series 2. Who the hell is going to care. I dont care about any of these characters now, let alone in 2 years time!This episode sucked hard, this whole show sucks hard. The characters are weak.Anyway, enough ranting.As a super Tolkien fan I am BEGGING you Amazon. Please fix series 2. Just sort it out. Everyone would respect you so much more for just fixing this disaster.Get Peter Jackson. If it isnt broke, dont try to fix it.

Partings indeed,"The script writers of this series look hard for ways to contrive their own mythology around LOTR. Sadly they lack the talent of JRR Tolkien and the result is inevitably woeful. The bizarre introduction of mithril as the one metal to rule them all on which the fate of elves rests is the strangest juvenile group-think from the script writers yet.The gulf between the concept and the realisation grows larger with each episode.

Parting from a good novel,Honestly. Amazon nailed it. They nailed the rings of power to the bottomless pit of dissapointment. The visual effect of this series is far better than other series but aside that theres nothing good to this episode. I thought at first that maybe for the next episodes it will be better but it became more evident that this series already loose more momentum. Maybe the main reason is all about the poor dialogue and sequence of per scenes. There is also some dull moment that not lead to nowhere.

I particularly enjoyed how the show accurately depicted her holding her own with the men in fight scenes just like the superheroes that is clearly designed to mimic. The insistence on diversity in the relationships is wonderfully refreshing and really adds to the authenticity of Tolkiens vision.Its so great that they have the budget to continue to make this product well into the end times.Allahu Akbar.

Forgotten storylines, horrific speech, comparable to GOT season 8, but without the redeeming element of Lena Heady. I wish you could erase memories from ones mind. Tolkeins name should be kept out of reach from the show. Tolkeins law is wrong because Amazon didnt buy the rights to everything needed.

No other way to put it. Gone are Ian McKellan, Kate Blanchett and Christopher Lee - and RoP does not hold a single actor up to their standards.Even 1/2 their standards would have been a vast improvement.Costume Department. Oh boy. From the scene at the town square with the crowd dressed in what looks like leftovers from a greco-roman themed LARP to the card board armor of Galadriel. How those things even got on stage is a mystery to me.Its not Tolkien. Ive been trying to watch it as a run of the mill fantasy production, but that isnt helping either.Its bad.

Horrible Ending to a Botched season Not Tolkien,Wow nothing in this series now resembles anything in Tolkiens books. Accept repurposed dialogue and some names and places. Everything else is some really bad storytelling pseudo intellectual or cringe dialogue and botched plots &amp; post modern themes. Galadriel is still unlikeable &amp; besides being 5000 years old completely gets duped by a dude non of which is anything to do with Tolkien wheres her husband &amp; daughter &amp; she should have discernment be wise royal ethereal &amp; commanding - Not Tolkien.There are no wizards in the 2nd age no stories of hobbits. There is no Mithral needed to save trees. Sauron did not school Celebrimbor in how to be a smith - Galadriel did not come up with the 3 rings - there is no cult of female witch kings searching for Sauron who is not a man. Elrond is not some oafish man matter of fact elves are not men - nothing in this series fits with Tolkiens world - Galadriels brother is reborn she would not be on a revenge trip.Where were the dwarves in this last episode or many of the other characters? The last episode and this make an extremely anticlimactic ending to a poorly done fantasy show - the problem is Tolkien wrote history - PJ told his team to write history and view the movies as such - this team cant even make good generic fantasy &amp; reveal themselves to not be real fans with breaking so much lore &amp; misunderstanding Tolkiens themes of good vs evil temptation and the ordinary being able to overcome evil &amp; suffering through trial &amp; temptation - sad to see some fooled into supporting this drivel - Not Tolkien does not honor his works themes or memory.,sk-mckenzie,1,0.6157894736842106,Yes,Alloyed,117,190

Also meme-worthy: the blind queen has to ask 3 times what the commander sees (a soulless CGI city with ships), and gets no answer.The change from Halbrand to Sauron was to be expected, but not particularly comprehensible and partly contradicts things that Halbrand did before when he was alone.",s-transiskus,1,0.6341463414634146,Yes,Alloyed,52,82

There was absolutely no suspicion of Halbrand until this point - even though there definitely shouldve been) showing the lineage of the Southalnds Kings ending a thousand years ago.Sauron is apparently in love with Galadriel.The high-point of the episode was one of the Harfoots getting murdered.Nobody has a plan in this ridiculous farce.Its such a predictable show that you can skip through most of it without missing a thing.What a waste of potential.I cant be bothered to make any more points, as it becomes depressing listing all of the clangers in this nonsense.",gpglenpeters,1,0.6044776119402985,Yes,Alloyed,81,134

The show goes in a complete direction to the legenderium and the writing is so bad nothing makes any sense. Galadriel whos supposed to have spent years looking for Sauron ( in this show which isnt canon) doesnt recognise him when hes with her for months and whats more she tells the south landers ( people who live in Mordor) that he is their king. She later finds out he is actually Sauron but guess what she doesnt even tell anyone and just lets him go freely to Mordor. I mean what was the point of everything. Galadriel archives absolutely nothing and Sauron archives nothing when Sauron is supposed to be a master deceiver someone who gets what he wants but in this show hes driven by Galadriel. And yes apparently the stranger ( whos probably Gandalf) arrives in middle earth on a meteor and forgets everything - he even doesnt know who he is, I mean how bad can the writing get when you have source material which clearly states that the istari came by boat with a specific purpose ( to unite the peoples of middle earth against Sauron) but no in this show Gandalf is completely hopeless and needs help from Harfoots.

This is now an alternate work and should not have no reference to Tolkien, the story has been so perverted. No wonder they paid 250 Million for the rights. At this point, someone from the Tolkien estate should sue Amazon. I do not understand how this could be made, changing the basic original work of the author. I read the.trilogy, the hobbit and the Silmarillion while in college. They were as a whole, a great piece of literature, a new legend of our time written in classic style.

Shes unrecognizable in this series as little more than an unlikable petulant teenage boy. A similar hatchet job has been done to Elrond. Hes now a sleezy politician.I realize there is some license that will be taken when adapting original works. However, Amazon used to honor their authors and stay true to the work.

Its like the writers are determined for us to just hate the series. Nothing makes sense. Everything is just a because yes situation. Everything is so obvious for the audience but not the characters, which makes watching frustrating.Everything its unbelievable (in the bad way): even the characters suddenly become stupid because the writers need hem to do something. Its just not organic. More than one hour per episode to barely tell any story. Just disappointing.The cast try to make it better, as well as the directing. But the writing just messes all up.

Run Away From All Tolkein Lore,"This was the most egregious episode yet.

Also only seeing them only forge the 3 rings that the elves keep and not all 19 rings of power was devastating for a true Tolkien fan. I wanted to scream and throw things at the TV. The elves dont figure out its Sauron until after he forges his One ring but Galadriel figures it out.... um sorry but no.... the show in total fell short of most of the Lore and the timeline of the age.

The only good parts of the series are Dwarf bro and Elronds relation ship. Seriosly did showrunners even read Lord of the Rings or Silmarilion books. Somehow Galadriel forgot her husband. Indeed, they will have daughter who will marry Elrond and have Arwen the future wife of Aragorn, but show writters ignored this fact. Hahah mr.

Its a bit cringe,"If it wasnt called lord of the rings, this show would be a subpar fantasy show.Dialogue at points is really cringe and odd.The white cloaked sisters arent spooky or cunning. Their leader walks odd, moves odd, emotes odd, shes so odd and not in a good way.Finally get some Sauron mischief and its instantly over. Didnt expect the rings to be made in one episode and Sauron not going to be there for the other rings being made?The whole season has been so painfully meh.The 3 LOTR movies and Rings have the same run time.

One of the worst episodes of television of all time!,"This was one of the worst episodes of television of all time in one of the worst shows of all time!It was incredibly boring because the episode did not make me care about the characters.The relationship between the wizard and the Harfoots does not work. The show did not make me care about those characters. So I dont care what happens to them. The question who is Sauron is not interesting either! You need to make us care about the characters first.The main problem is Galadriel. She is badly written. She is always right and that makes her uninteresting as a character. Another reason why I dont care about this show.The Harfoot story line does not work either. Again, you can only reap the benefits if you set up the story properly.And its so slow!

The lore is great, they have the money so CGI can be amazing, the story runs on a age when you can use characters that everyone ALREADY love, they just needed competent writers to create a cohesive story.

The finale the series deserved,"Everything that I expected from an awful show.Whether there are supposed to be explanations for half of the scenes in series 1, in series 2, Im afraid it is too late to even care.Now that the Sauron has been confirmed, I can only speculate on what he will be shown to be responsible for as part of his deceivious ways. The decisions of Galadriel? The decisions of Numenor? The ignorance of the Southlanders? This show is exhausting and devoid of any character sympathy. Their decisions are illogical and dont seem to stem from motivations rather the need of the plot.The decision to involve both Galadriel and Sauron in the forging of the rings seems ludicrous and the forging itself lacked any weight.The CGI was very impressive I parts but my disbelief is again not suspended by the wider show.This is not Tolkien and it is not Lord of the Rings.

Likely the last episode Ill watch.,"First, I understand that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy. This same goes for any adaptation or based on. While the Lord of the Rings films remained mostly (Jackson and his fellows made some serious mistakes, but in twenty years when its remade, itll be even less of a good adaptation), true to the books, they took such a U turn on the Hobbit to make it unwatchable. Go read my reviews of each film. Here, everything is bad and feels off. You cant put the.3,441 years of the second age into one human lifespan. Its an insult to the books. Second, who did this casting? Morfydd Clark should be names Morbid Clark for all her lack of emoting. Does she have any range? Elrond is already a thousand years old, yet he seems like a dunce. Again, the Harfoots. Did they do any research at all? There are three ancestors of hobbits, Fallohides, Stoors (Gollum descended from Stoors) and Harfoots. Why are hobbits in this at all? They played NO PART in the second age. NONE. And again, Galadriel isnt only a warrior (which she isnt), shes an olympic class swimmer! This part was ridiculous too. Galadriel chose to remain in middle earth at the end of the first age. She didnt jump overboard and swim back five hundred miles to middle earth. Certainly not without drowning in her gown. And she callously abandons those people to die. A lot of people on here and Amazon complained about their being black elves, dwarves, hobbits etc. I dont give a damn about that. But getting people who could act would be a huge boon to this show. As a Tolkien fan since 1976 and who, like Christopher Lee, re-reads the books every year. EVERY YEAR, Im disgusted at how bad this show really is. Im going to spare myself any more annoyance and simply not watch.",mhorg2018,1,0.42857142857142855,No,Adrift,3,7
The Rings Have the Power,"Having only seen 30 or so minutes of the first episode before turning it off, Ive got to say ROP is AMAZING. Gongleflim is spot on, ripped straight from the pages of Tolkiens original epic films. The elks are magical, although Im not sure why they dyed Orlando Blooms hair (cant wait to see how he gets his hunting bow and flaming arrows!). The quest to the Mountain of Shrilm feels as if Im reading it and watching it at the same time (again, just like in the original ROP where I felt I was watching it as I was reading it). Fancy the hobbits? Well theyre back too, no sign of Frodo yet, but I think I spotted him as one of the younglings in the scene with the trap doors and woodland Dinglers (and yes, the Dinglers are as frightening as ever!). I hope the second half of episode one is as explosive as the first. Some say Tolkien would be rolling over in his grave, if he is its to grab a mug of Middle Earth Butterbeer and enjoy the rest of his and Amazons achievement.",JBHeinous,1,0.375,No,Adrift,3,8
Where did all that money go? How was there not enough money for a good script and talented actors?,"I was hoping till the last episode that some major twist will happen and after seven unworthy episodes somehow the show will come together and leave a good memory. There were significant twists, but not in a good way. I cannot believe that Amazon went for depicting one of the most important moments of LOTR history (forging of the rings and events leading up to it) and with all that money poured into it they ended up with such a weightless, impactless show.

I really could rip this craptastic snoozefest up, but whats the point? Two years until the next season? Ill have forgotten it long before then.

Rushed episode that puts the final nail to Galadriel character,"This episode shows how the slow pacing of the previous ones has been done in a very wrong way. They were holding development of events to have mistery boxes for season finale, so they had to resolve so many things at ones.Because of that, we got the expected Sauron reveal, being the obvious candidate, Halbrand. In the previous episode he was mortally injured, but after SIX days of riding he arrives to the elven realm to get cured. Hes cured in just a few seconds and inmediatelly after he goes to see Celebrimbor and starts to trick him into making the rings. The entire plot of Annatar tricking the elves and forging the rings is then resolved in just a THIRD of an episode, incredible rushed, it only takes a couple of sentences with very bad dialogue (bassically he lectures one of the greatest siths of all time how alloys work with pretty basic stuff).In the middle of this, Galadriel just START to suspect theres somethig bad about Halbrand, and ask to investigate the bloodline of the South kings, discovering that it was lost and he actually is not a descendant. Following the reveal, which could be the most interesting part of the episode, with interesting thoughts, but again, incredible rushed, Sauron dont even attempt to deny what a paper says, he couldve say many things like its an incomplete archive, but no, he bassicaly reveals himself and try to seduce Galadriel....Sauron says to Galadriel thet if she were to reveal his identity, she would have to explain that she has been helping Sauron, and thats the final nail in the coffin for her character. It turns out that Galadriel indeed brought back Sauron of his retirement, he wanted to be a simple smith on Numenor or something after being betrayed by Adar and lost the orcs. But now he has a claim to the Southlands, he stroke a blow against his mortal enemy and knows how to create rings of power, thanks all to Galadriel. He also may influenced lords of Numenor thank to that as well.This last episode only works to conclude that the writting of this season is pretty bad, theres really nothing wrong with slow paced plots, but they did it in a bad way and have to rush things in the end. Dialogues are bad, unintelligent, thats how you got a master smith that knows nothing about alloys or training sessions with lines like stab and gut. The plot is lazy and forced, all that happens are events and plot devices to make the characters react to them. Almost all the main characters are completelly unsympathetic, mostly the good ones are the villains. The show also does not follow the lore, it seems it only uses trademark to get more audience, most of the lore that uses is from peter jackson movies.",luisq05,1,0.5757575757575758,Yes,Alloyed,95,165

If not that and there skin woild be covered in snow and ice. Not only that but where is the cold breath, why is her hair perfect and blonde and not frozen at all after being in cold so harsh that it was putting elves down?Then galadriel kills a troll while all the other useless elves watch. We get it shes super powerful, while the guy questions everything and is wrong, typical.The Hobbits were very silly and looked horrible. Im also for diversity, but having read the books and watched the movies it is just inaccurate and takes me out of the middle earth world.Elrond looks horrible, weird casting choice, and frost bite galadriel? Really? You couldnt even see your breath in the cold, but you got frostbite? I thought the red rosy cheeks were atleast because of the cold, but nope thats just the makeup for all scenes... Bad writing + directing.Back to the Hobbits and holy crap they look bad, with the amount of money put into this it is pretty inexcusable.Back the the elves, some very poor looking costumes, the gold leaf crowns look like something you would find at a thrift store. And of course the men elves are wrong about everything. Elrond is just so bad.Introduction of the black elf. Only took 1minute for a you people quote, really Amazon?Its crazy Peter Jackson offered to help with this series and was rejected, but it definitely shows in the quality and poor writing.

The chosen actors are really unappropriated for their roles and their characteristics have changed a lot compared to the book. The illustrations do not feel like what I read in books and as a Tolkien fan, I can not accept it as a series representing middle earth. The books had details enough to illustrate and it did not need this much change and going away from the book and story and involving the modern world policy in the show! From my point of view, in the best way, It is fanfiction of middle earth and does not deserve to be titled with a masterpiece name like the lord of the rings!I had been waiting for a show of this amazing world almost for a decade as there were rumours about it.

Galadriel feels off too, of course another complaint is the hairstyle choices, looks modern it sticks out like a sore thumb. Some of the acting feels abit theatre, melodramatic and not actually movie acting this is more towards the Harfoots. There is glaring issues of pacing and all around lack of foundation of engagement.

Thats NOT how you make a fantasy series,"Fantasy worlds are so engaging because theyre so rich, beautiful, and boundless. You want to run away there from your exhausting routine. That was the case with original LOTR trilogy created by Peter Jackson. It didnt have to be perfect, but it was enough to make viewers feel immersed in the marvelous world of Middle-earth. We wanted to come back there. After a day, after a week, after a month, after a year, after TWO DECADES. Its 2022, and people still love this trilogy, and not because of the feeling of nostalgia, but because Peter Jacksons Middle-earth is still the most anticipating epic fantasy world every seen on a big screen. After two decades, its still on top.So just imagine that one of the biggest studios in the world decides to bring this universe back to life and is ready to invest a BILLION (!) dollars in its development. Jeez, you have all the money in the world. You have all the time in the world as therere simply no competitors whod spend so much money for one project. You can hire all the talent in the world. And yet you produce this frightenly mediocre piece of... work. Is it freaking possible?When Im talking about this show being run-of-the-mill, Im not talking about diversity or other makeovers that go against the lore (and were criticized by many fans), Im talking about poor writing, boring directing, dismal acting, overwhelming computer graphics.

TERRIBLE,"This show is a complete travesty. Acting, directing, pacing, dialogue is all awful. Costumes look like they are from a high school play, CGI and most of the scenes are abysmal. The plot line so far is typical hollywood garbage, virtue signaling is more important than actual story. Very few of the characters are adorable or even likable for that matter. Oh yeah, poor editing throughout the episodes. There is just way too much to list wrong about this show. The main protagonist IS GOD awful and cringy in almost every scene.Erase it all and start over, writers/directors/most of the cast.

Junk,"Terrible acting and the whole thing is based on CGI. They are trying to do things and change things just to change things and make things equal. The fact of the matter is to give other actors work and the like and use the feeble minded to make money is disheartening. Because Prime likes Tolkien means nothing and makes this irrelevant. If someone liked Tolkien so much, then make it in the 1970s or 1980s. It shows you, money is usually giving to the wrong people, but that is cool. Further, there was not one elf women why have them. No one associated with this junk comes close to the skills of Peter Jackson and they want people to like this over and under acting and terrible direction, but thats the business.

nothing makes sense,"There are moments in life where you need to ask yourself whether or not youre missing the point and are just lost in a sea of absolute insanity? When a story has gone so far afield that the ideas being portrayed are completely and totally lost to you and the people within it are beyond broken in a way that isnt fixable.Rings of Power has been one such example of a narrative and an attempt at something that is this out of sorts broken and lost.This whole series nothing has made sense, from characters being willing to do something that contraindicates their progression to plots that arent even supposed to be in a story to begin with, everything has been lost and broken since the very beginning.That is a problem when youre trying to craft a story that has lasted nearly a century already in the public mind and one which the public are very protective of.What were you thinking of when you were permitting this, Amazon, I do not know nor do I care. So imdb, spoilers incoming, tag is on and nothing breaks the rules yet.The man who saved Galadriel in the first two episodes from drowning in a storm is the Dark Lord Sauron. He saved her for no reason, he resisted power for no reason and he followed the main character of this series for no reason.And he didnt even take part in the forging of the great rings by Celebrimbor.The main character of the series has unleashed a blight onto the world that takes 2 and a half thousand years to finally deal a deathblow to and she has yet to tell a single soul on Arda what she has done.I had been sure that the writers had some integrity to try and be in any way S. M. R. T. and double bluff people, but no apparently everything that we all assumed was and is the way it always was and is.Mordor is the South. Galadriel is a power mad tyrant and Numenor is going to be led into chaos.Yknow what wouldve been far smarter, anything than this but even better that you wouldve shown Galadriel trapped in Mordor by Sauron now and the woman in Lindon building the Rings is actually Sauron as at this point in history he still has his shape shifting ability, it was taken from him after he corrupted Numenor into evil and Illuvitar sank it into the ocean for them trying to steal the immortality of the elves. Itd make sense that she still wants to make the rings, why shed be able to give up her one precious item and to actually think this is a good idea.But no, having her actually be evil, having her actually do this without telling people and to show Sauron in his supposedly fair form in Mordor is how we end this.There is not enough Whiskey in the world that can help with this and I have no hopes for anything in the future of this series, its not even fan fiction because at least that stuff tries to show respect to the source material instead of this.",HardLight,1,0.6454545454545455,Yes,Alloyed,142,220
"one hour down, seven to go","There are ways to do a prequel, and then, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power does them all wrong. It takes six or seven things everyone remembers from the famous movie trilogy, adds a water tank, makes nobody fun, teases mysteries that arent mysteries, and sends the best character on a pointless detour. The latter is uber-elf Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) who spends the premiere telling people to worry about Sauron. In response, people tell her not to worry about Sauron. Thats one hour down, seven to go this season. Sound like a billion dollars yet?Tolkiens saga was anti-industrialization, which makes it hilarious that Rings of Power is an Amazon product. (Imagine Saruman throwing an Arbor Day party.) Much press has swirled around the production cost, but if a huge budget made great TV, wed be on Terra Nova season 12. Showrunners J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay show no instinct for pacing. Some characters seem to teleport far distances, while others walk slowly between villages (despite horses, like, existing). A big sea attack looks unfinished, introducing a massive threat thats quickly forgotten. Director J. A. Bayona finds isolated moments of grandeur, but the helicopter shots get repetitive fast. The fights arent quite up to the Walking Dead level, and the battles wont make any Crab Feeders nervous. Frequent cuts to an explanatory map are more funny than informative.Viewers hungry for Middle-Earth Anything could be satisfied, and I guess you could argue Rings of Power is no worse than all the other expensively empty genre adventures (Altered Carbon, anyone?) that have proliferated through the streaming era.

Why someone let them write the script for a billion dollar series is beyond me.I can live with the departure from Tolkien, but at least give me a good and believable story.

Okay, you get one sentence: a huge strength of the women in Tolkiens writings is being able to tell which battles are worth fighting, and not running head first into challenges and fights to prove that they are the best and the strongest, actually.More than one scene had me actually wincing because it was just painfully bad to watch.All in all this show serves just one purpose: Showing once more the PJ movies are unique and stellar and we will probably never see something as good as the original trilogy.",elenaschimpfle,1,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,3

Characters are completely misrepresented and unlikable. Dialogue is forced, cheesy, and bland. Storylines are nonsensical and leave you wondering why you should even care what happens.

Tolkien was very precise with his world and history, he wanted it to feel real.Also, what Tolkien (and Peter Jackson) understood was that the magic happens when we look at his world through the eyes of a Hobbit. For instance, Tolkiens elves are ethereal, otherworldly and mysterious. The elves in this show are just mundane humans with pointy ears and a knack for pretentious discussions.

Modern politics and ideology forced in to gain cheap appeal without any deep storytelling and theme that made the original works so compelling. Male white characters generally portrayed as an obstacle or incompetent - why could this be? Also dont understand why people are raving about the visuals - too much cgi and bad costume design make this even worse than the hobbit trilogy. Could have been something great but the focus of the creators was in the wrong place. If wanted more representation etc. At least make it a compelling story and somehow explain this within the existing lore and if not then make a different show. Dont need everything in there to please everyone all the time.,jamiemhill-31767,1,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,2

Bored out of my Skull!,"I cannot believe how bad they made this script. The characters make terrible decisions, the head elves know the evil is there but arent willing to do anything about it, the Harfoots do literally nothing and Galadriel is supremely unlikeable as a character. None of the characters act anything like they did in the books or in the Peter Jackson original trilogy and the dialogue raked against my senses like a cheese grater against my eardrums. I would come up with an analagy that better describes it but the show didnt bother, so why should I?Even the action scenes are boring! This is especially true when Galadriel did her spring jump into wire-fu and her team gave up on her. Honestly, I felt more for them than for her. If she wanted to keep traveling, the least she could have done was go back and get more provisions before leading her team into the abyss and their deaths. The scene with the troll was especially bad when none of the elves EXCEPT for Galadriel were even fighting! None of them even made a single move! They looked like they were going to, but then a giant ice chunk was thrown into them and that was the end of their contribution to the scene. After that, they died and died some more because only Galadriel can be seen to do anything! The only way they can think of to make her look competent is to bog everyone else down into incompetency. This is a perfect word for the show itself, incompetence! You can gawk at the visuals all you want. First, theyre not that great. Second, visuals do not make the show!

Unfaithful adaptation and insult to Tolkiens legacy,"Theyve alienated the fans by their statements and created something they wanted to create, instead of making a faithful adaptation to the lore. The characters are not in situations authentic to the lore, and modern sensitivities have crept into the work. One can clearly see the difference between the great deal of respect that Peter Jackson had for Tolkiens work versus these showrunners who disregarded what made this fictional world so endearing to generations of fans from all over the world.This is why the trailers are getting ratioed and the response to this show has been overwhelmingly negative by actual fans.The heart of the philosophy of Tolkien is missing from this show, and the people who made it would literally hate Tolkien were he alive today.",dmjrnbsn-30762,1,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,2

Need an armor ? Go to Ikea !,"First of all dont watch this show if you have a degree in Tolkiens work or if you are a fan of his work. This show is miles away from what Jackson did past years that even The Hobbit trilogy wasnt that bad.This first episode doesnt sound like one. No presentation of the story line, you have to digest a lot of information about the world, the characters, bad/good guys and but you still dont understand the purpose of this show.All the characters looks british (no offense) and their acting are really bad. I was really disappointed that the dialogs between elves have been act in english and not in elvish as you should expected from a multirace fantasy franchise.CGI is not good not bad and fortunatelly they still can fly helicopters to take beautiful landscapes from NZ however the OST is inexistant.Finally costumes and armor look cheap as hell.

Its easy to get carried away, and it feels like the creators fell into this trap - no credibility at all.The music is underwhelming, its almost like the composer had an AI machines output music based on a reference - unfortunately the composer is not worthy to polish the boosts of Howard Shore - theres no soul at all. Very disappointing.The characters are forgettable and Im left with no interest to follow them any further - quite an achievement considering the source materiale they had available.The acting is okay, namely from Morfydd and Robert, and they are the reason for the 2/10 stars.I might give another review when the full season has been released, but rest assured I will not pay a dime more for watching this travesty.",ajodreas-17909,1,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,2

Where are the dwarven people? There is 1 scene with the boulder smashing with lots of people, the rest is just Durin 3, Durin 4, and Disa.

"The farce is complete, this is just LOTR fan fiction","Congrats, if you made it this far. Lets summarize this nonsense.-So as everyone and their aunt guessed, Halbrand is Sauron of course. No big surprise, the one character who is not from any official material. Except, his plan makes zero sense. Did he pretend to be a Human, have Adar kill his fake family (because Adar clearly did not recognize him 2 episodes ago), escape to raft with other southlanders and just... HOPE that Galadriel will jump off the ship and somehow, get to that specific raft???And yes, we get the whole Join me and we shall rule Middle Earth as father and son... I mean, king and queen! speech alongside the other evergreen classic, We are not so different, you and I... because yes, sure, the person who hunted you for centuries will believe you just want peace and redemption. Pull the other one. And apparently he can just enter peoples minds and make them see anything? Seems like an useful power that he should have used before to get Miriel to do what he wanted... instead of relying on Galadriel to convince her with words. Though, again, why did he even need all this charade? The writers probably thought the whole Annatar thing would be too simple (where, as in the original books, he shows up as an Elf from faraway lands bringing the gifts of the ring-creation), so instead he does this roundabout nonsense to get to Celebrimbor, instead of showing up as an Elf whod be instantly trusted.The worst part? Now, we will have the Dark Lord, the main antagonist of Lord of the Rings, be played by this super mediocre and boring actor for who knows how many seasons. Great. The showrunners also said Sauron will be Like Joker, an antihero and that just fills me with dread.-Galadriel remains insufferable. Upon returning to Eldriador, she all but tells Elrond yes, you were wrong and never says I effed up by staying behind. Then when she finds out Halbrand is Sauron and awakens to be greeted by Elrond she does the classic how to identify a shapeshifter trick by asking him something only the two of them know. Except... did she just forget that Sauron a minute ago was in HER MIND showing her a memory of her brother Finrod, that ONLY SHE KNEW? Dumb, dumb, dumb...
Then, inexplicably, she does not tell the others that the idea for how to save the Elves comes from their sworn enemy, no, she lets them proceed. I half expected the show to pull another trick that this Galadriel is Sauron, and we will cut to the real one waking up, but no, I gave this show more credit than it deserves. It really is THAT badly written. So everything is Galadriels fault and she does not even have the courage to admit Sauron is back?-For some reason, the rings need silver and gold from Valinor and somehow the only such item they have is Finrods shortsword/dagger? For reals???I get it, OMG Symbolism!!! But still felt forced. The Elves probably brought a LOT of that stuff from Valinor with them.-Despite the show trying to fool us before the opening, of course the Stranger was Gandalf. Not called by name, maybe Amazon does not have the rights, or they wanna milk the reveal, but clearly it is him. Follow your nose, Return to the shadow from whence you came! - direct lines from Gandalf from Lord of the Rings... the whole adventure speech, it all adds up to that. Again, I gave the show more credit than they deserve, I assumed the Morgoth/Sauron cult are trying to trick him and bring him to the real Sauron to be killed or corrupted, but no, these idiots really did not recognize an Istari and really thought he was Sauron. Why would Sauron even lose his memory and need to learn his powers? Why would he fall from the sky as a meteor, when we has been on Middle-Earth? The last war ended centuries ago, he did not just arrive back, he has been around for a long time.I am not even surprised that the three ladies have ridiculously powerful abilities. Not even Gandalf or Saruman had such powers - shapeshifting, immunity to fire and the ability to create and control fire at will? The Dweller (who oddly never talks, maybe was not paid for it?) can even do the whole force-push thing Saruman and Gandalf did in Fellowship. I mean, why be surprised, these people care nothing about the lore, but magic is not something regular Humans and Elves can do...
And then, after grabbing the staff, Gandalf banishes them because... they are RINGWRAITHS??? BEFORE the rings have even been forged? WTF is this shit...?-At least Sadoc died. I expected him to say at the end nah, I cannot go on so leave without me, same way we left you and your family behind because of a twisted ankle. Then inexplicably, despite Gandalf having re-grown the whole apple orchard, the others just continue their wanderings instead of staying at this lush and plentiful place? And despite Nori telling Gandalf that one adventure has been enough, and clearly having learned his lesson and wanting to settle back to normalcy, her family pushes her away to follow her heart and leave. I guess the writers thought it was poignant, I saw it as more proof that everyone hates Nori and wants her to leave.-Not much happens in Númenor except Elendil and Míriel talking a bit using sentences no real human would ever use. And the king dies, so sad, pity we never knew anything about him. I am reminded of how Viserys died just the same week on House of the Dragon, and how touching and sad that moment has been, because I truly liked and cared about him.I literally laughed at the screen when they started the really badly sung Legend of the Rings at the end, because -- this makes no sense this way anymore. If Sauron wanted all other rings bound to the One, he needed to forge it already, and he doesnt even have mithril. Whoopsy-doodle! The song even says the Dark Lord in Mordor and I was like, Sauron does not even know it is called Mordor - Adar never told anyone but his Orcs!Maaan I am morbidly curious how much worse this thing can get in season 2? Maybe a civil war between Adar and Sauron... though given his powers, it would be over quick. And we completely skipped the forging of the rings - nor do we even have human and dwarf kings they could be given to, only Durin III. Where will the Witch-King of Angmar come in? Surely these writers cannot resist to give him a tragic origin, where for one whole season we will believe he is a good guy. Or maybe they will just turn him into the Witch-Queen of Angmar? Apparently, Círdan is coming in season 2 too, cant wait to see how they mess him up. Maybe Celeborn will be revealed to be alive, waiting centuries for his wife to come for him... in vain.",bbshockwave,2,0.7114624505928854,Yes,Alloyed,180,253

Aside from absolutely butchering the canon, I could at least excuse that if the writing was decent. But its not. The standoff between Galadriel and Sauron was just cheesy AF, the idea that mithril has ANYthing to do with the power inherent in the rings was lazy, and the worshipping sycophants of Sauron and how they acted towards Gandalf when they thought he was Sauron made zero sense, and the transition into the big reveal where they figured that out was again, just cheesy.The writing on this show is so bad.

Elven rings are made before the others and of course Galadriel has to be involved because why not right? Harfoots remain useless and their story line boring.

I cant believe to finish this season because Im hoping to get what viewers deserve, an epic execution of series that madeby Tolkien but Amazon blunder it perfectly. My brain cell died to this series.

If you dont think this is stupid look at how victims of Pompey look like many miles away.Bad writing, with unnecessary tension, and stuff not making sense. As making isildur look like he died and copying a scene from two towers were it looked like Aragorn died. There is really a lot of bad copying from the LOTR movies.Bad Character development.

You dont to decide who will like or dislike your show or how they should like and know about LOTR books, or project motivation on people not liking the show.They are doing it for valid reasons, because you are taking the work of someone else. Tolkien who is your intellectual and creative suppurior who you will never equal and you are screwing it up for no other reason than that you bought it right.YOu never earned the right you bought withj it with Amazon and it is really big difference, while you destroy what he has created and wrote.

From the beginning if you look the map of transition phase of the scene you can already saw that southland locate on mordor. And the hint about halbran is sauron is too obvious.

You get left behind to fend for yoursel by the others because of an accidental injury and yet you choose to speak of being faithful (or whatever his speech was, I watched it dubbed to our language). This episode is either boring or eyrollingly melodramatic. There is no deus ex machina to save the villagers, they just do. Although the explosion was powerful enough to destroy buildings, whatever, ok... Galadriel finally shows some humility and is remotely likeable. Noris feelings towards the MeteorMan are on a rollercoaster. I still dont care who he is. They make Elendil look weak, they make Disa look greedy. Does anyone actually proofread these scripts?

I never laughed so hard in my entire life.The dialogue is bad, the writing is bad, the script is nonsensical, the music is over the top, the acting is mediocre, the sets are bland and dont look anything like I imagined them from the books, the original characters are even worse than the canon ones.Basically its a mistery box show, about a mistery box, for a mistery box, in a mistery box, with a mistery box, to a mistery box and at the finale, you get a reveal that is bland, stupid and predictable.Ill give it two stars for the comedy, the rest is just pure trash.",caliminted,2,0.42105263157894735,No,Alloyed,8,19

Really bad ending to a mediocre boring show. YA romance with silly mystery boxes.,They made galadriel into a really stupid character who falls for the dark lord and makes him king. And then when she finally has her suspicions she goes to confront him alone instead of telling others and confronting sauron with an army of few.The showrunners turned Tolkiens works into so cringe YA romance with dumb mystery boxes. Absolute waste of an opportunity.And to even imagine that sauron turned to evil again only because galadriel rejects his advances feels so silly.The direction is bad too. The writing is horrible. The characters dont feel like Tolkien characters at all.The music and some wide angle shots of landscape and architecture are the only good things.The harfoots are an absolutely boring addition that add nothing to the show.

Why did the kid say to Galadriel that she is taking it too personally and passionately and its not her fault? He hardly knew her and she hadnt shown any big passion against the orks, especially at that moment! Clichés and forced emotion all over! And the best way they could find to reveal the creation of Mordor was to write the word Southlands and then replace it with Mordor!!!

Illogical decisions and bad writing....,"There have been so many illogical decisions made that it no longer makes sense. Its as if the writers believe that we viewers are stupid and incapable of thinking for ourselves.1. What was the point of Adar releasing Arondir after he attempted to flee in episode 3? Arondir has just killed some orcs, and he will undoubtedly work against Adars plans. He was then rewarded with the opportunity to be released and deliver a message to the people of the town. Adar could easily have told a child or an elderly person (not an elf) to deliver the message, or as the evil overlord that he appears to be, he could simply ignore that fact and use brute force to enslave the humans like previously.2. Also, what guarantees that Arondir will walk to the townspeople rather than running to the elven camps and bringing an army, as planned in episode 3? We know Arondir loves a human woman, but Adar does not, and it is extremely strange of him to bet all his money that Arondir will follow his plans without question.3. Adar has spent so long trying to go unnoticed, and now he doesnt even care? These orcs are like vampires in that they cannot leave the house during the day, and fighting with anyone during the day would expose them greatly.4. In addition, at the end of the episode, when Arondir meets Bronwyn and Theo.... Why did Arondir flee from the orcs and even kill one when the wise overlord Adar had given him permission to leave?It seems odd for Adar to let him leave without telling any orcs not to kill him, given that he has an important message to deliver....The scene in where Galadriel escapes from the prison is also a little cringe-worthy... There are only four guards, and she managed to push them into the cell without a fight. What is a typical human reaction if a prisoner escapes any awake guard? Perhaps they will yell and call for help, and she will not be able to walk out of the prison.... The entire scene is reminiscent of a soap opera. From the dialogue in the series thus far with Galadriel, she appears to be an angry college student, but with the ability to never make a mistake and to always be correct.One aspect of the show that I have enjoyed thus far is the dynamic between Elrond and Durin. Every scene involving those two and Durins wife Disa has been fantastic, and their actions do not appear illogical or misplaced.",nick7900,2,0.4375,Yes,The Great Wave,7,16
Watching LoTR being ruined in this fashion is heartbreaking,"What this show lacks in quality storytelling, it also lacks in acting and over-embellishment in nearly every single scene. Its like they watered-down fantastic and rich storylines that exist in JRRs world and turned it into a drama-heavy romantic show. What i cant get past is the intense focus on minuscule arguments in every episode. They are so irrelevant and over-acted, its DEEPLY cringey. This show will be perfect for a lot of people that look for that, however its so far from what made the original LoTR great. It also seems to have much less of an edge. Im not expected any of the scary and couch-clenching moments from this series that existed in the movies. Also, I will say Im not a huge fan of the hobbit, however they still had a great story, fun comedy, and a lot more purposeful plot points.

Surface Level,"This is like a Childs story. The writers seemed to have lazily researched Tolkien too create their own fan fiction. Even then its boring, typical, predictable, dragged out, and drama filled. The cast seems like they are in a play. So this is what the Billion dollar budget can create? Its very disappointing.Visuals are good at times, but everything seems too shiny, from the outfits of the commoners in Numenor, to the elves in Lindon. They motivational speeches given by the Main characters lack depth and build up. Yet the audience seems to always be aloof and swayed very easily.The characters seem forced, like they are reading off a script.

How to destroy Galadriel and fail screenwriting 101,"This episode is a very disappointing finale to a very disappointing season of a very disappointing show.The big problem is the writing. Its consistently bad. The Tolkien lore went out the window a long time ago, but even if you dont consider the show a Tolkien story, its still just a bad story told badly. Almost nothing makes sense: Time, place, motivation, continuity - all of it feels like it was written by 10 different novice writers who never talked to each other.This episode reveals that Sauron is Sauron. Yes, we all knew and said that it was Halbrand, but still we had to have a silly scene where the cultists mistake Gandalf for Sauron. And when he kills them, they look like Nazgul. So they are the Nazgirls. Its not an hommage to LotR. Its just a corny attempt to piggyback off the LotR trilogy just like the Gandalf lines such as follow your nose.But the worst part of the show is the Sauron reveal and the forging of the three rings.The Sauron reveal makes no sense. Galadriel rides to Eregion with Halbrand/Sauron who is wounded. Here she doesnt tell Elrond and Celebrimbor that Sauron is back, that the Numenoreans have come, that the war has started and that the volcano has turned the Southlands into a dark place ruled by the dark lord. Instead she keeps it to herself. And when she finally realizes that the Southlands havent had a king for centuries (shouldnt the elves know this?) she confronts Halbrand who is then revealed as Sauron. She doesnt tell ANYONE that Sauron is literally in the house. And when he leaves she doesnt tell ANYONE to follow him. Instead she goes into the forge and lectures Celebrimbor about the creation of rings. He wanted to create one or two, but Galadriel knows that three is the right number. Okay... I guess the point is that Galadriel knew that it was Saurons plan to have Celebrimbor create one or two rings and by creating three, she stopped his plan. Wow. This lady has been chasing Sauron for thousands of years, and when he is right around the corner she literally tells no one and lets him get away because making three rings instead of two is a much better plan. How about not making any rings at all if thats Saurons plan? How about at least waiting a day or two to discuss the forging of rings? Or at least tell Celebrimbor that the guy who told him how to make rings is actually Sauron, so Celebrimbor, the legendary grandmaster smith, would have a chance to create them without the influence of Sauron. But no. Galadriel wont tell anyone anything apart from lecturing and giving orders. She literally acts like a maniac, and the show gives us no reason and no motivation for her maniacal behaviour.How is it even possible to write an episode like this? How do you turn a popular character like Galadriel into a complete maniac who acts in unfathomable, contradictory and wholly irrational ways? Galadriel is now literally responsible for the rise of Sauron and for centuries of war, death and destruction.The dialogue is horrible. The plots make no sense. The continuity is non-existent. The pacing is abysmal. The characters are either wooden or maniacal. Who are these writers? You could go to any writing class and pick a student who would write a better script. And this is the most expensive TV show ever!?! Wow.",vaderis,2,0.7478991596638656,Yes,Alloyed,267,357

Was this show written by teenagers?,"This episode had the most action of any episode so far, and yet somehow I felt like it was also the most boring? This show continues to have dialogue so cliché and corny its hard to fathom. I cant blame the actors for their bland performances. Daniel Day-Lewis and Meryl Streep couldnt deliver these lines without being wooden!Every trope of a badly written show comes into play in this one, including plenty of Deus ex machina, characters having ludicrous plot armor, etc. If its the most predictable contrived thing you could think of, itll happen in this show. This show feels like a fantasy soap opera more than a serious dark fantasy show with any semblance of weight to it. Its season 8 of Game of Thrones all over again; this might be the most disappointing show ever.This is really the best Amazon could come up with with their unlimited budget? They planned this show for years and it still feels poorly planned and not well thought out. However many billions of dollars they spent on this show and they couldnt touch up Galadriels roots while they shot the scenes for this episode? (Not a serious gripe, just thought it was kind of funny that its noticeable in a show with this much money behind it). Guess it goes to show that money isnt everything when it comes to creating something like this. Doesnt seem like the people behind this show are the bump the lamp types.This show feels incredibly dragged out and stale already, and I cant imagine the writing is suddenly going to get better; it seems as if the showrunners went to their local high school theater production and randomly selected a couple of them to write this show. Wouldnt it be super epic and a cool twist to have a character who was somewhere completely different come out of nowhere and stab the big scary orc in the back, saving one of the main characters at the last possible second, after the orc demonstrated he was strong enough to throw Arondir cross the street with one arm, but somehow isnt strong enough to overpower him while trying to force a sharp stick into his face!?!?! the writers say to themselves. No. Its stupid. I predicted it would happen 2 minutes before it happened, it made me roll my eyes when it did, and Im sure Im not alone in that. This show just doesnt feel like it was written by or for adults.The only saving grace is how technically proficient the show is, but at this point not even that can save how bereft of anything interesting, entertaining, or otherwise substantive this show is.",raccoonfan69,2,0.51931330472103,No,Udûn,121,233
Generic Fan Fiction - certainly not Tolkien,"It truly is sad what they have done to Tolkiens legacy! To call this travesty Lord of the Rings is just not in any way true. To say this is Lord of the Rings is akin to a cook making a Beef Stew with colorful vegetables for brightness, starchy potatoes for texture, loads of gravy for substance, and a sprinkling of beef so you can call it Beef Stew! That is exactly what they have done here, a sprinkling of Tolkien to call it Lord of the Rings!Virtually 80% or more of the story is fabricated, with names, places and other references thrown in to assert that this is based on Tolkiens lore. One-dimensional characters (Galadriel especially), absurd happenings (Galadriel easily handles two soldiers twice her size and forces them into the brig), boring and unnecessary plot lines (townsfolk hunger situation, Arondir love interest, and Numenoreans hate toward Elves) add nothing to the narrative.Tolkien and his fans deserve much better than this!",gdes52,2,0.5405405405405406,No,The Great Wave,20,37
"Preposterous Drivel, An Instand Classic In Schlock","I get that some have enjoyed this show (Im happy for you, truly), but no way this is the BEST episode of the show. Every single scene was mind bogglingly stupid.I want to hone in on the scene with Galadrial, Isildur, and Elendil and the ship (the boat scene heretofore). Isildur sneaks to the deck at sunrise, and speaks to Galadrial. He notices land on the horizon, and Galadrial says she has been able to see it for AN HOUR. The intent is to exhibit the heightened senses of elves (despite already being well established epusodes earlier). Jackson exhibited this fact masterfully in the much memed taking the hobbits to Isengard scene in which Legolas helped the Fellowship make sense of an apparent unit of uruk-hai they spot far off from a mountain vista.The PROBLEM is that the boat scene makes no sense. On a ship, you cant see land because it is blocked by THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH (on a flat earth you would be able to see far off land everywhere assuming a clear atmosphere). Anyone who has been sailing knows the horizon is only a few km away, and therefor anything you see is either very close or VERY tall and far away. Look it up.Therefor if the ship is sailing 10 knots (18km/h), for example, the ship would have sailed to the horizon line at -1h 15-20 minutes after she made the observation. If she had seen a rocky coastline, they would be shipwrecked by then; if she had seen a mountain peak it would be a MASSIVE presence within an hour. We even see on Queen Miriels map how they are sailing into a huge gulf, so there is no way Galadrial could see land an hour before any human noticed. Unlike Legolas, in the aforementioned Peter Jackson scene, who was looking at the same thing as Gimli, Aragorn, etc, but was uniquely capable of percieving it.WHY does this even matter though? Like, who cares, amirite?? Peter Jackson understood that this kind of lore (elves have heightened senses) doesnt really develop character or progress the plot (they could have found the trail to Isengard in many ways), so he nested it in a quick moment, after a HUGE plot pivot (fellowship split). This show is dumb, so they do WAY too much exposition of trivial stuff, but never establish important foundations for plot points to pay off. But they couldnt even get the basics right to have characters STARE AT THE HORIZON! XDPretty much every scene in this episode is world-class schlock. Ostirith is apparently made of Jenga (and is next to a large body of water???). The Numanoreans ride horses at FULL GALLOP through hills, fully armored, into the Southlands (boy, those horses must be tired/crippled for life by the time they are anywhere near the village).Bronwyn, the arbitrary leader who has already displayed completely unearned martial expertise, survives 2 arrows to her unarmored, organ-filled torso (contrast to Merry and Pippin EARNING their stripes as warriors in RotK, and fully armored Borimirs death by arrows with confession and redemption to Aragorn, who btw EARNED leadership through decades of work).Halbrand is simply declared heir to the throne, no questions asked by anyone, because he has a royal symbol on his mojo-bag (IRL, royal regalia is extremely common in any monarchic society because it is how people recognize the status/symbol of royalty).Every character in this show is dim-witted.The dam-flooding-tunnels-volcano thing was also brainless drivel. A dam break like that would cause a HUGE mudslide and tsunami, easily sweeping away the town and collapsing these non-reinforced tunnels. Why not use that scenario to challenge the characters (Southlanders and Adar alike left to think on the fly)? Why would they have the collapsing dam not-do-what-physics-dictates in order to have a volcano erupt in an equally preposterous way.",Deb_Morganfall_6773,2,0.8333333333333334,Yes,Udûn,5,6

"It just gets worse, someone deus ex machina this show please!","Where on earth do i begin? WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE A FORTIFIED TOWER TO END UP IN A VILLAGE IN THE COMPLETE OPEN. There was so much defensive tactics that could be done, like blowing up the bridge and being behind stone damn walls!!! And if they did get in, there was a great killing floor. Oh no, instead they go to a completely unprotected village. Why? Because screw your intelligence, thats why.So the first wave arrives, and they set off that trap, fine, not a bad tactic, but immediately it all falls to stupidity. The writers honestly cannot write. When discount legolas gets into a big old tumble with big orc man, were meant to believe the orc didnt come with any weapons? Really? And i called it straight up, single mum commander florist deux ex machinas her way to save the day.Now they realise its a ruse by the orcs, why? The orcs could have steamrolled that place but oh no, we need to be stupid so the story can happen. The florist commander takes an arrow (thank god) but dont worry, shell be walking around later.Now the real orc army turn up and oh my jebus, they try to fortify an inn....errrr you left a FORTIFIED TOWER FOR A BUILDING MADE OF WOOD. Adar gets in and threatens them. Great, this is good. But oh no, now comes the biggest deus ex machina of the century.

There is so much stupid in there that science just got knocked back 200 years.So mount doom blew off and a pyroclastic flow billows over them with galadriel standing there in the open. She, along with everyone else, are now dead. Shows over. A wall of 800 degrees+ of air and rock flowing from an erupting volcano = absolute 100% death. No arguement about it. Theyre dead.

This show builds to nothing and delivers nothing. Thats the breaking point for me,"This show fails to deliver on what was one of the main building points of its story so far: how Mordor came to be.How?The orcs threw some water into a volcano.Wow. A bit underwhelming no?The evil-looking sword? Just a key to open a watergate. Nothing evil about it actually.The orcs dug trenches all the way to the elven watchtower and they did not notice? Really?The volcano erupts from normal water touching the magma? Umm, thats not how volcanoes work. There is a difference between a volcanic eruption (lava, pyroclastic cloud, etc...) and a vapor eruption.Everyone in the village should be dead. Oh, Im sure theyll try and pull something along the lines of the volcano is actually cold, so the lava doesnt burn
Sure, but Galadriel and everyone else will still die of:
a. Her face ripped off by the force of the blast and the stone projections
b. Asphyxiation
Once again, the show tries to build false tension and fails to deliver on it in spite of showing us that all these people should die.But there was some action, so its good, no?Well, no. The action is horrendous.It was needlessly bloody to the point of making my wife and I uncomfortable.Was the gratuitous shot of the blood dripping onto elf-mans mouth really needed?And very little of it was interesting.A massive orc grabs our elf hero and instead of killing him just throws him around.(sigh) are we still using 2000s action movie clichés?The pacing? The orcs politely pause while we cauterize the wounds of that herbalist lady.Then Numenorians charge across a field in the morning light then we cut back to the village still in darkness in the middle of a battle.The timing is just plain confusing.The teleporting? The Numenorians are here, then they teleport across the land to arrive just in time.How did they know to go there? Why the plot fairy told them of course.The tactics? We abandoned our villages to go defend the far more defensible tower, to then abandon it to return to our village.Um... Why? Because the plot fairy demanded a flat area for a cool horse charge.I laughed out loud when the Numenorians used that chain to trip over the orcs.Is this a gritty action scene or a goofy battle? Pick a tone and stick to it please.Oh, and Galadriel wants to torture prisoners of war and genocide orcs.Awesome, so shes a sadist on top of everything.This is a big breaking point for me.This was the big episode. The big battle. The epic build up. And what do we get?A small skirmish in a nameless village.The Numenorian army of a few hundred soldiers versus a band of orcs.Was that the big threat to Middle-Earth? Really?All it took to defeat them was a skirmish that was both too gritty and too goofy, unrealistic, poorly paced and with very little tension (we know youre not killing those characters, stop pretending otherwise)

"Best episode so far, just because is filled with battled and for that, we got to see less of the bad narrative","This is a battle episode, and because of that, its more difficult to screw things up, yet the writters manage to do so.Bassically this episode is about orcs assaulting the south vilage where our heroes are. It starts with Adar leading orcs to the Keep the villagers were fortified, it starts odd, like Adar have read some of the script, instead of bashing the door, he casually opens it, and no one is behind it. Hes lucky there was no man behind it ready with a spear or something to kill him....It is revealed than the villagers left the stone fortified Keep that has only one point of entry to instead fight in the wood village that can be overrun by every side. They say that the village has only one entry point, a bridge, but if you look at it anyone can cross that river by foot, they do nothing with the bridge and in the end, they actually got surrounded. So pretty bad choice.The smart thing was that the Keep actually is a pretty bad building, the tower is hold only by a rope that can be destroyed with an arrow, and the elf makes the tower collapse on top of the orcs, killing a bunch of them. Seems that the elves did nothing to repair that tower in centuries but holding it with a rope.Anyway, after that, we got to the battle, which is mostly an ok battle with dumb moments like the elf crossing with a huge unarmed orc to fistfight, or scenes with no stakes in which they tease the death of someone, but you know they are not going to die. Tey also reveal that some of the enemies are not orcs, but humans, and its supposed to be huge and shocking, but we already saw the humans join the enemy 2 days ago so its actually expected.The battle ends up being lost and they go back to the tavern, they call it keep, retreat, go back to the keep, to steal from the Peter Jackson LotR movies, but its no keep, its a wooden tavern. They tease again with the dead of a character that has been pierced with an arrow in another dumb scene. In the middle of the battle, they try to perform surgery to remove the arrow, dont do that, wait until the battle is over.The wound starts to bleed deeply after removing the arrow (thats why you have to wait, in the case some artery or something got damaged) and they cure it by superfficially burn the wound, also not smart thing, that wont stop internal bleeding. But alas, the character lives.All this takes a while and they are not interrupted just until after the character lives, the orcs outside wait a few minutes to start bashing the door and getting them.In the end they are saved because by force of the script the Numenoreans know where to go to fight orcs, and they charge in the dawn, like in OJ movies with the charge of the rohirrim.They fought the orcs and Adar retreats, being chased by Galadriel who speaks to the horse to keep riding, like in PJ movies, when Frodo was being haunted by Nazgul.The battle is won, Adar captured, teasing his dead 2 times, no stakes this show. And they show Numenoreans bonding and talking with the horse, calming them with elven words, like in PJ movies.The big reveal of the episode is that the magic key sword works to open a dam, just by the elven Keep, releasing water that connects with the tunnels that Adar order to create, that leads to Mt Doom, making it erupt and covering the South in darkness, which is now called Mordor after a PPT presentation.Really feels very dum than the magic sword only opens a dam, and that the tunnel lead just bellow the Keep. It seems that they can excavate hundreds of miles of tunnels, but cannot break a stone wall. It also seems that elves, despite having super vision, were unable to see the orcsdig tunnels of hundreds of miles long, open to the sky, that lead to their main base.Yes, this is the best episode.To end, the episode features an incredible blast of ashes and fire that destroys walls, but you know its not going to kill any of the main characters, even if they are not shown taking cover or anything, they receive the full blow, but they wont die. No stakes in this show.",luisq05,2,0.5454545454545454,Yes,Udûn,6,11
Find my self rooting for URK,The plot has disappointed me in some ways. I dont feel like there is any big peril impending to all. The enemy seems ill prepared and weak. Maybe just concentrating on just one village was wrong. They could have shown few different places in south lands to show the gravity of the situation. More of a point of view from enemy would be helpful. Lord of the rings was a action adventure movie and there were very little suspense elements. There is no point keeping enemy point of view in dark till episode 6. It just makes Galadriel look paranoid. Numenor came all the way to middle earth but for what ? Just cause an elf told them ? It seems like much ado about nothing.,mihir89,2,0.514018691588785,Yes,Udûn,55,107

By looking only straight ahead and hardly moving her, what appears to be, uninjured eyes?Or maybe the tiny little leaf that stirred the balrog?Or maybe the sad fade out away of the southlands label only to reveal.....

Why did you cast her and write her like that? You have completely ruined Cate Blanchetts legacy!So far we can say that the show is complete disappointment that has left the majority of people upset.

Even if you stripped all the Tolkien stuff away (of which, lets be honest, there arent many!) it would still be just a mediocre show. It being Tolkien makes this a lot worse...

She was so bored and I enjoyed hearing criticism from someone who just read the Hobbit for the first time. Even she had a better sense of Tolkien than these writers!From my perspective, the story was bland and disjointed. Nothing climatic. Nothing that made me feel happy, sad, excited, joyful, in suspense, relatable, or even appreciate the tone Tolkien delivers with his stories. This whole series is a mess. But its like a car accident you drive by on the freeway and you cant help but be curious about how bad it is. Ard to look away.

Starting to collapse,"All the plotlines are really starting to collapse.The people that feared ROP might change lore, oh boy are you in for a treat.

Eventhough people hated her before.. now shes rallying the people. How? And why dont they just run from the orcs? Its all just so nonsensical.I havent even mentioned the worst storyline, the boredome of Numenor. A kingdom of more than 2 million where sending a host of a few hundred warriors leads to a terrorist attack. The terrorist is caught and saved by Isildur who decides not to tell everyone it was pharazons son. For reasons??And all of this happens at a snails pace.

Boring and Bad,"The writing for this show actually reminds me of B class fantasy movies straight to streaming services (i.e. The Princess, of Disney+).At this point it feels as this show is a mockery to all Tolkien fans across the world. The latest deviation of lore into mithril origins feels like a slap on the face. Its just... I cant even find words to describe how badly it feels.Galadriel is as awful as usual. No redeeming qualities to this character, though fencing scene was choreographed pretty well.Nobody cares about Harfoots. Its the least interesting plot in the entire show. Cent get invested and both female Frodo and Sam are annoying and not interesting.Absolutely subpar plots of all main characters. I think the only one who is still half way decent is Durin. Thats it. I believe that they tried to show inner conflict within Adar, but its just look unnatural. Why would he get enraged about mention of Sauron? Dont even want to to mention Numenorians and the Southlands.Here were half way through the season one and absolutely NOTHING HAPPENS! Its a one thing to write a fan fic, its another to actually make it interesting. By comparison, house of the Dragon looks as they managed to pull it off and its simply excellent.Im almost done with this show.

It goes worse in every episode and story is really awful. Not saying about lore (it is already disaster) but general writing of the series is too modern and cheap. Too shame, such amount bugdet and great visuals but awful scenario.Galadriel part of the story is worst. They are trying to make her great in every way. It is dine if you do this in right way.

"Twists that do not shock, just make you go WTF?","This episode introduces some very major deviations form the established lore and I am sorry but it just breaks thing on so many levels that it kind of hurts. Mithril coming from an tree that contained a silmaril? Apparently any knowledge of Tolkienian mythology is absolutely.redundant at this point, bothersome even because knowing the original story just makes one angry and bitter but I digress. Using the logic of the show, what are even the Silmarils? They keep on throwing around all these words that book fans know, like the Silmarils, Aule, Feanor, Earendil and so on as if they expect us to know who they are (because they never really explain any of them) but then go and disregard major themes and events. This episode just went too far.Other than that, Galadriel is still an entitled Karen though her fencing was kind of cool. I still don´t really care who is Meteor Man. The Arondir plot just is... Durin is still fun. The visuals are still very nicely done. For the Fencing and Durin I give an extra point so the rating is 2/10 even though my gut feeling was 1/10.The funny thing is, that with every twist there the receiving character had as much a WTF face as I did. What is more shocking than the twists is watching the weak attempts of the writers to come up with a gripping story but the legwork and setup for these twists is missing. The only ones who are surprised by them are people who already know the story. I like a lot of the actors, costumes and locations. I guess it is too late for this season to be saved but Amazon please get rid of whoever writes your scripts at the moment and come up with something INTERESTING for the next season.

"More boring, bland, and not Tolkien!","Simply stated in the title of this review its not compelling whether the stories or characters - Best read the books or for a great adaption watch the Oscar winning LOTR trilogy esp the extended versions and enjoy the extras the care taken by PJ writing team crew and actors who honored Tolkien and kept their politics out of it.ROP looks expensive in some shots but falls way short on plot characterization and dialogue, coming across as boring, cringe, and unintentionally funny at times - this is not even good fan fiction coming across as CWish like generic identity politics modern fantasy with all the tropes associated with post-modern ideology.This boring bland and Not Tolkien episodic slow burn continues with more bad dialogue and nonsensical decisions from key characters. Its not even decent genetic modern fantasy. Not sure which earth the showrunners and writers came from to try to claim this is based on the book and is the novel Tolkien never wrote.This adaptation isnt actually based on Tolkiens works or his world. Amazon looked at the Lord of the Rings appendices for their source material, but they appear to be about as related to Tolkien as D&amp;D or World of Warcraft. The show itself intends to tell its own, more modern story, with a more modern approach to characters but will also to use the names and places established in Tolkiens lore. Its a sort of bait and switch tactic by the creators to get views. I could say something like, its not based on canon, but thats overstating the issue. Its not just not based on canon. This isnt even the same universe. Despite using familiar names and places, Its a totally different place. It has totally different rules from the ones established in the books. It is therefore not recognizable as a Lord of the Rings adaptation or prequel.",sk-mckenzie,2,0.684931506849315,No,Partings,50,73

Its just boring to watch and hard to enjoy the little salvageable parts of the show because of that sole reason.Also Id like to add that lore wise Galadriel was never in Numenor in the way they are making this to be just like on many other aspects of her whole character... we know they have creativity freedom to add or remove parts of the story as they please, but to drag on something made up for 6 long as* episodes?

Theres plot holes everywhere, not one character is interesting, I dont even know what the story is about anymore and it feels like a 90s TV show were they drag it on and then say find out next episode! The only problem is I dont care about what happens next episode because I cant get into the show.

This time they blew Tolkien to smithereens,"The writers have already destroyed Tolkien lore in more ways than anyone could have imagined. But this time they blew it to smithereens.There are many extremely ludicrous events in this episode, and the dialogue continues to be laughable. Nothing makes sense, and most of what the characters say is nonsensical. The writers seem to hope that we wont notice because they deliver so many lines in gramatically incoherent fake-tolkienesque ways. But characters are literally not answering each others questions, and they use idioms that sound clever but make absolutely no sense when you stop and think about it.I wont go into the sword scene. Its silly, unrealistic and unnecessary. And it just adds to Galadriel being extremely unlikable.Instead I want to mention the whole mithril thing. This is beyond stupid, and it is a complete violation of basic Tolkien lore. Now, suddenly, instead of mithril being a rare and precious metal thats both lightweight and strong, its a magic substance literally containing the light of the Silmarils?!? Are you kidding me?! And it popped up because a Balrog whipped a Silmaril at a tree while fighting an elf during a thunderstorm or something like that. And then the lightning flowed down through the roots of the tree to create mithril ore veins. And the mithil is both good and evil (ying/yang) because of the Silmaril and the Balrog. Seriously?? The Silmarils are all accounted for, and there is a point with the whole Silmaril story. And mithril also has an established story. Many known objects are already made by mithril. But now the show says that magic mithril can save the elves who are dying, because it has some sort of life force which comes from the light of the Silmarils. It is such an unessecary deviation from everything Tolkien that I can only conclude that the show writers are spitting on Tolkien and the Tolkien fans on purpose, wanting to send a message like we have the power to make whatever stories we want. They simply have no respect for the fandom.",vaderis,2,0.64,Yes,Partings,16,25
The final straw,"I can see how if you are not a Tolkien fan and have little interest in his works and lore, you may enjoy this title. But if you are in any way invested in the works of Tolkien, it is clear now, despite what they said before this show, the showrunners have no regard for Tolkien. From the start, they have changed characters beyond recognition as written (and no, Im not talking about casting choices).Galadriel is the clear example, a female elf, thousands of years old, who lived in Melians court and showed great discretion when pressed on why the Noldor had come to Middle Earth, is now a truculent child.Adaptations necessarily make accommodations but the showrunners have gone way beyond this. They have no regard for the spirit of Tolkien, a man who is on record for hating allegory, by painfully inserting allegory at every turn to make Rings reflect the world we live in. If I wanted that, Id watch a show specifically written for that purpose.Their shame is they have highjacked Tolkien to use as a vehicle for their clumsy writing, dreadful dialogue, and tired modern tropes. They have no art, They have no creativity of their own. Good visuals and music cannot hide bad writing.Then we come to this episode and the mithril plot line and the fading of the elves. Utter drivel. This is doubly unfortunate as the parts with Elrond and the dwarves was watchable, unlike the rest, and now theyve ruined that as well.I give up. This is the worst kind of mystery box fiction that has borrowed a setting to illustrate how incompetent Amazon is at making anything truly great. Such a shame given the potential. Perhaps, if they had spent more and actually bought the rights to just Akallabeth they could have pulled this off.As for non-Tolkien fans, enjoy!",paul-559-385905,2,0.5740740740740741,Yes,Partings,31,54
Spectacular writing!,"One of the best examples of contemporary quality screenplay! Galadriel is witty and warm, making every viewer empathize with her and her cause. Her outstanding diplomatic ability allows her to rally everyone to her cause, through well-thought lines and charming personality.The harfoots plot line is very interesting and it kept me at the edge of my seat.But the best part of the episode was the banter between Durin and Elrond, culminating with the line Give me the meat, and give me to me raw!.

Its much less canonic than most fan fiction out there. Its almost a mockery of Tolkiens world.</li></ul>One example of lore butchering (there are myriads):They have completely butchered Elendil. Now hes some sort of captain instead of the son of Amandil, Lord of Andúnië. Thats right: The true Elendil is soon to be Lord of one of Númenors chief regions. Hes practically a prince. But when he is in front if queen Tar-Míriel the woman does not know him.Even if they removed the whole Lord of Andúnië thing, the queen must still be a complete idiot. Both she and Elendil descend from the same forefather Tar-Elendil, fourth King of Númenor who is son of Tar-Amandil. Yes, Elendils father is called Amandil. They are both named after their forefathers Amandil and Elendil - who are also the forefathers of Tar-Míriel.Does the queen not even know her own kingly lineage? This is an insane butchering of Tolkien lore.Another thing: The actress playing the Queen looks very nice, but shes supposed to be fairer than silver or ivory or pearls. Now, be honest - are you as a viewer blown away by her beauty - a beauty unrivaled by any other woman? No, you are not. Even if they thought the casting was on point, there are things you can do with the camera and lighting to make her stand out. They didnt. They made her into a grumpy middle aged woman with one or two facial expressions.They have reduced Galadriel to a teenager with a personality disorder. They reduced Elendil to some sort of captain (now also dad to a girl, which is untrue). They reduced the hobbits to psychopathic nomads who leave the weak to die. They reduced Elrond to a diplomatic discount-Neil-Patrick-Harris. They reduced the mighty Durin to an emotional doormat. They reduced the Númenoreran super men to a ragtag bunch of islanders. And altogether they have reduced the world of Tolkien to a school comedy. Its dilettantish pantomime. At best its half-baked fan fiction.One and a half stars. Ill be nice and round up to two for some of the CGI landscapes.",vaderis,2,0.6666666666666666,Yes,Adar,2,3
It doesnt concern the Tolkiens legacy,"No way. The most boring fantasy Ive watched since the Wheel of time. I couldnt watch it the last 20 minutes. There is nothing about nor Tolkien nor The Lord of the Rings. The acting is extremely poor, especially Galadriel. As well as her plot line is the poorest in this series. The plot line with Anadriel looks quite alien, his love story seems very artificial. No chemistry between characters.The story of Finrod was changed and its bad for story, because of its poorness.I was dissapointed because of lack of elvish language.Only landscapes and music are quite good, as it should be. Thats why - two points.",voliac,2,0.25,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
missed opportunity,"The acting feel disingenuous. Looking at how they interact, it seems forced and awkward. The dialogue lacks the depth and charisma once found in high fantasy. The scale of the environmental setting is extremely minimized with little passage of time for the audience to grasp. Several large deviations from the heroes journey and even the appendices material from which this was inspired. Too many modern tropes shoehorned into the story. Not to mention, rather than complimenting each other, characters seem to be at odds. This includes antagonist, protagonist, and their supporting characters. I hope it gets better. If not, this looks like another Wheel of Time or Shannara Chronicles wash. It seems rather grand to slap a LOTR label on this. Sad day.",nnectar,2,0.25,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
How to murder a Classic,"Pretty dull, to be honest. It clearly cost a lot to put together - but you cant help but wish that some of those millions were spent on decent scriptwriters, more appropriate casting and maybe a few continuity experts.The story, and the cultural traits of the various types of folk - elves, hobbits, men - just dont really ring true to the source material. The speech patterns are very off - and inconsistent, with some characters making an attempt at the otherwordly non-accents, and others sounding like the just came to the set on the London Underground in 2022.Rambling and, to be honest, it rather makes you wish they had made a better fist of it.",mtjelliott,2,0.6153846153846154,No,Adrift,8,13
Poor attempt at Fantasy. A dreadful reimagining of Tolkiens world,"I watched this episode with someone who never read the Lord of the Rings and we both agreed it was poorly executed and rather soulless, even as a piece of Fantasy.The score and costumes are very nice, but ultimately end up being the shows only redeeming feature.The dialogue is sloppy and inconsistent, with characters following the stiff prose of the movies one moment and becoming quip heavy Marvel Movie characters the next.Its fair for the most part, but some scenes are so bad that I found myself shaking my head, forgivable for a late 90s Fantasy series, not for a series with a multi billion dollar production value.Overall I was left feeling rather sad. This does not appear to be a labour of love, or even a passable adaptation of Tolkiens Middle Earth, but an entirely new creation whos existence seems to be based on an antagonistic relationship with its source material.I hope I am wrong, but I think this is not the show for me. Life is too short to watch bad fantasy shows and I love Middle Earth too much to watch it be vandalised.",houndofautism,2,0.3333333333333333,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,3
Beautiful but horrible story and acting,"The picture is beautifully done, I just dont get the story and unnecessary scenes such as when Galadriel was looking at the map, and for some reason pulls out a knife to only point to a mountain. WTF was that all about. That was so unnecessary, like point to it with your finger. Also the orc fight scene was a bore. She fight it all on her own and, no team work at all. I understand it is showing her strength, but if you are on a journey and fighting a big ugly Orc, I think there would be some team work.I hope this series gets better and they have a budget to redo it because right now it terrible.",shoppingwizely,2,0.3333333333333333,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,1,3
One star for visuals and one for representation&diversity,"Everything else is terrible and boring as hell.Writing, directing, editing, actors and action scenes would be below average even for a low-cost production, but here we are talking around 80M$ each episode.The end credits are longer than the scenes where I got at least a little bit of interest, just because SOMETHING HAPPENS!It doesnt feel like Tolkien, Middle Earth, Lord of the Rings AT ALL!Its a generic rip-off of some generic fantasy tropes all put together without a vision.No emotion, no thrills, no goosebumps, nothing, I watched the first 2 episodes and I feel nothing, not even the curiosity to know how it ends.",gianlucaerriu,2,0.3333333333333333,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,3
"There are some good moments, but...","This is not Tolkien. At first, I could feel something... something what reminded me to Middle Earth, but I only felt it because the writers choose to copy Peter Jacksons opening.What was good? Landscapes. The CGI is convincing in most times. Sometimes, some costumes looks real... but thats all.The problems? Oh, there are PLENTY of them.Whats with people and with the letter R? Nobody can pronounce Galadriels name properly, she is more like GáLLádRRiel. Also, Morfrydd Clark pronounces everything in a weird way what has a R letter in it. Morgoth sounds like MoRRgoth, Valinor is VáliNNoRR, Elron is ELLRRond However, this is the smallest problem.Galadriel NEVER ever went on a rogue mission to hunt anyone. He was NOT leading anyone into war, she was NOT a warrior amazon - the amazon word in the books refers to her beauty and power, might. She wasnt bullied by kids - this behaviour isnt something what elves would do.Short haired elves? Why? And why most of them look like ordinary people? There is a reason Tolkien wanted them to be pale, angel-like creatures with long hair: to be DIFFERENT. Now they just look like simple humans with pointy ears. What the hell was with the prop team when it came to the armors, at the celebration at the council? Galadriel and others wore ugly, simple, cosplay-like armors. In the best case Id say it was cheap armor for humans who take part at a duel... but not for elves, in a celebration...In the cave, Galadriels soldier says that whoever left this mark should be dead since hundreds of years. I mean, its Saurons sign. Why would he be dead after a few hundreds of years? He is immortal. And even if the sign was carved by an orc, its still a sign, it leads to somewhere...Harfoots: They were NOT early hobbits. They were HOBBITS. A different tribe, but STILL hobbits. And not relevant at the 2nd age, sorry. And obviously didnt live on... carts... what he heck.The dialogue...Galadriel: I need more menElrond: i want to hear about your adventuresGaladriel: You became a politicanBecause he said he wants to hear your adventures? What?Nori: Asks a woman about what wonders might be around the worldHarfoot woman: tells her that they are safe on the road and they adapt to the seasosn.Okay, and how is this related to Noris question? XD.About diversity: a good example why is this done in a wrong way. Nothing feels original, independent, unique. Why? Because you see the SAME races in every single take. From the biggest cities to the smallest villages and even camps: people are diverse as hell. Which really takes away the magic: there are no visible different cultures and people, everyone is literally the same. Its kinda disappointing. Like, when I go to travel to Japan, Id like to see asian people and see their culture, try their food, etc. But if go there, and everyone speaks, looks, behaves like everyone else around the globe... then i could just stay at home, right? There is magic in different people, different races, cultures. Stop mixing them ALL the time...
What about elf-human love? It was forbidden. There are like 3 known cases in the whole Lord of the rings and Silmarillion... why did they create another one?Why is Celebrimbor old? Elves are either young or ageless, but he clearly looks old.Galadriel jumps out of the boat right before reaching Valinor... by the lore, and by the map they showed up, its clear that she is extremely far from the land. How could she swim this much?The man who fell from the sky... is he an Istari? He must be... if he is an istari, then, congratulation, Amazon made another mistake. None of them came to middle earth at the 2nd age...At first, this isnt a so bad start. However, as a lord of the rings show, its horribly inaccurate. Id rate it as a 2. If it wouldnt be called as Lotr, Id go for a 6-7.",dandi-90750,2,0.3333333333333333,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,2,6
Desperately trying to epic and epically failing,"The best way that I can sum up this series is as follows;Imagine that you gave the Am-Dram Society from Hot Fuzz a million dollars a minute in costumes, sets and cgi - and said have at it!.It looks vaguely Tolkien but the dialogue is, Im sorry to say, truly awful. The story line is scattered, the pacing is terrible and the constant switching from this bit should be serious to this bit should be light-hearted makes an absolute mess - make your mind up showrunners, is it a serious program or a bucolic comedy?My wife fell asleep, my two daughters were bored senseless and I was constantly wondering what part of anything that Tolkien wrote is this based on?However, lets skip any argument over its authenticity to written material and just concentrate on what has been presented.The story is very poorly explained, my wife and kids have no idea what is going or how this relates in any way to LOTR. I dont know who any of these people are or what any of them are doing! was my wifes first comment at the end of the episode.Want to watch the next episode? I asked...

"Still keeping up the bad dialogue, and in addition slow and boring","The second episode still suffers from bad dialogue, but in addition add in a boring plot that goes nowhere.Talk about a slow plot. This episode just plods, but then strangely suddenly finishes with nothing to hook you into wanting to watch the next episode. I mean have they learnt nothing about people who binge watch shows rather than watch shows weekly?!?! Anybody bindging would probably stop watching the show and give up.And spoilers... thats clearly Gandalf. The way the trees behave when hes angry is totally reminiscent of the time he got angry with Bilbo. So in a prequel in which Tolkien specifically didnt write Gandalf these writers are going to suggest that Gandalf love of Hobbits came from their made up characters. What is this The Timeless Child or Mikey Spok?!?! Stop inserting your awful characters and then pervert the story of the creator to pat yourself on the back, because everything they wrote now only happens because you inserted your characters as the reason the original story happened. Talk about stolen glory!And please can we stop this anti male tripe. Not all males should be stupid or evil. How about a bit of balance?And strangley after all the promotional material that tried to push Disa as the first female dwarf, and wind up fans up, she and Durin were probably the best characters in the series so far.",steve_greenway,2,0.5833333333333334,Yes,Adrift,7,12
Unlikeable,"This is terrible. Im rating what the show is so far. Galadriel just killing a troll with the expression of someone killing a fruit fly, without an error or anything. If only she was with the Fellowship when they fought the cave troll, she is so unlikeable, Everyone is this show is so unlikeable. A kid thinking rats are under the floor so he gets pissy and screams and hits the floor with a poker because the writers wanted a jump scare. God this is awful. The harfoot girl is so dumb and annoying, we see theyre afraid of just 2 men walking near their home but apparently a man being shot from the sky and can levitate rocks isnt scary to them. Youre just trying to do another Hobbit centered story which weve seen twice already, we dont need it. You have the ability to do world building that isnt confined to hobbits learning of the world beyond them, but youre treading it again. You could have used the time with the halflings for more Khazad Dum or Numenor, but no look at the harfoots! God, this show is a bigger slap in the face than the Hobbit trilogy. I hope it gets better but this is terrible. House of the Dragon is so much better.",thejackcrosby-78543,2,0.5833333333333334,Yes,Adrift,7,12
Still at the beginning of the episode,"And Im already livid!!! The acting is so bad I can barely watch it. Two tiny Harfoots pushing a big carage with a man inside and they arent even breathing heavily!!! A huge creature has fallen from the sky in a ball of fire, he grabs your hand and you arent screaming??? Yes I know, strong female character etc. But the way you are trying to show that is so cheap and fake it makes her seem stupid. Please make an effort to make it even watchable. The budget is there, the franchise is there, the fanbase is there. It cant be that hard!!!

Meanwhile, Galadriel searches Sauron for 100 years, but has no idea about a whole human kingdom being destroyed by evil, which must have happened some time ago, since it is half a continent away. Thankfully, a survivor meets her in the middle of the ocean, like these things tend to happen.This show is a cruel joke on LotR Fans so far.

Power Game Of The Rings of Thrones,Worst of the episodes so far....descends into generic fantasy guff. Galaderiel is more unlikable than ever.The death of the elf by the orc takes on comical value as I have had worse wounds when shaving.The dialogue is utterly childish as would be a discredit to fan fiction to label it such.The score has also taken a hit in this episode and resembles a television movie....the cringe at the slow-mo horse riding scene is palpable.Halbrand is the incredible hulk it seems without the green as we got the obligatory back street fight scene.Im quickly losing interest and it is regrettable the makers of this show have taken to calling its detractors names.,truecrimescotsman,2,0.6451612903225806,No,Adar,40,62
I really tried...but its not worth watching,"In episode 3 we find out that Galadriel somehow managed to act even more horribly to people. The harfoots showed their true colours of being absolutely evil to even people in their own town! And Arondir achieved....nothing? How did his friends even get there? Oh what an episode...it seems like Amazon had to write Galadriel as the most insufferable pain in the backside imaginable as thats the only way to make her a believable love interest for Sauron/Halbrand.The one thing thats really sticking with me is that all of the budget evidently went onto the CGI and setting. But all the good CGI seems to be very sparse. And lets not even get into most of the sets, a good bit of the CGI or any of the costuming and props (that sword Muriel gives isnt exactly the one that Aragorn took from Elrond). For over a billion dollars spent, 97.10% of this show looks so cheap, weak, amateurish and incredibly painfully fake.Add that to the completely nonsensical writing, iffy/bad acting, and slow-mo pacing -- you get an expensive disaster that fails in almost every way to pull the viewer in at all. But no one can really point any of this out without being labeled a bigoted a-hole. Perfectly sensible.",ID_Mac,2,0.6,No,Adar,27,45
better than 1 and 2?,"Better than 1 and 2 but that isnt saying much at all and the bad is even worse.The hobbits are even worse than before and I thought maybe they might be Okay. Oh how wrong I was. I love how they just let people die in their travels. They picked that idea up from Galadriel. Why do you write people to just leave the weak to die.Speaking of Galadriel, how can she be more awful? Here is episode 3 and she is more awful. The great leader and she treats leaders of a city with disdain and threatens to kill them? In front of hundreds? Wearing only a night gown? I know she can kill trolls in one swipe but hundreds of people might be an ask, even for the greatest of all time. Oh and now the man is the King of Men. So we have the LOTRs story arc there.To juxtapose this destroyer of all, we have the other elves. Captured and when they try to escape, a worg immediately tears one apart. The elves clearly spent all their time training only one elf and decided to let the others sit around and clap while Galadriel did so.No dwarfs. Probably a good thing as you dont need to constantly change areas, especially when telling any sort of story in normal time restraints, is beyond the writers.It will only be a matter of time before we get a tortured soul that wants something real bad, like something precious.",carlstar-87626,2,0.5225806451612903,Yes,Adar,81,155
It just gets worse.,"Im sorry but as hard as I try I just think the rings of power is awful, couldnt give a damn about the casting as acting is just acting.Dont care who they cast just as long as the show lives up to the LOTR.But the whole feel of the show is just way off the mark.The warg cgi was terrible, the time spent with the hobbit-ish folk is boring and pointless apart from Gandelf being introduced.Really had high hopes for this as LOTR has always been my favourite set of books from since I was a child.Only hope is that the show picks up speed and starts getting to the point as Im losing interest fast, which hurts because I loved the idea of expanding the world of middle earth.",adamjdavis-91950,2,0.5416666666666666,No,Adar,52,96
Really horrible writing. No continuity and MANY questions (bad questions),"1) horrible writing/continuity in the episode:

Confused Mess,"This is perhaps the worst pilot episode Ive ever seen. Theres no coherence at all. Whenever tension starts to build it cuts to some other over-produced, cluttered scene full of stock characters. It doesnt seem to have been written, but rather compiled by lots of cut-and-paste from a dozen other sources.We have a single brave elf who thinks evil is lurking over the horizon, and everybody else is too stupid and lazy to understand. Of course this brave elf has to be female, and also physically stronger than a dozen male elves in hand-to-hand combat with a gigantic monster.Having black characters is also quite silly. Tolkien made it clear that his great trilogy Lord of the Rings was all about creating an English myth of the distant past, one that does not actually exist. (Go back a few centuries and the English are French, then Roman, then Celtic, etc.) This follows in the tradition of Robin Hood and King Arthur stories. There are no black African or Caribbean characters in this mythic past. Its an English myth. A black artist or technician can perform any of a thousand roles in such a production, from writing to directing, from carpentry to production design. One thing a black person cant do is appear on screen as a mythic British character. Its just dumb.I also watched the second episode, but Im done. Its expensive garbage.",spokeconrad,2,0.25,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
Seriously Lacking in Engaging Storylines and Characters,"Not sure I can continue watching this series or if I have enough curiosity to. There isnt one character Id be grieved over if killed by an orc. In fact, I wish Galadriel would be written off.As for story line, the writers would have done well to have cut three-quarters of the script, and let Peter Jackson (the director of the original LotR trilogy) rewrite what was left. Actually, anyone who cared about characterization and story structure would have been advantageous.All in all, even only three episodes in, the series feels like a long, dragged out attempt to sensationalize, franchise, and modernize what couldnt have been a great series, especially for the amount of money spent on it.",firstakit,2,1.0,No,Adar,1,1
Mediocre start to the show,"This was infact a disappointing start to the show and I am glad you released the second episode as well. First of all, the pacing was off and this was a drag to get through.Eventhough this deviates a from the books, I wish youd shown more of Galadriel and Finrod to make his death more impactful thereby giving weight to her quest. Even the atrocious committed by Morgoth and Sauron are barely shown with any meaningful screen time. So why should I invest in this quest of Galadriel.Then comes that action sequence where none of these Elven warriors could land a blow on the Orc but Galadriel with minimal swordsmanship took it down. No creativity whatsoever!",bonyjoseph-29960,2,0.25,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
Worst so far unfortunately,"Im really not sure where this is going now. It feels as though they dont know what story they want to tell. I was interested in the first episode, and then I enjoyed my time with the second. The interactions between Durin and Elrond were a lot of fun. But there is nothing to that extent in this episode. I just found myself losing interest or just nodding off altogether. I watched the episode earlier today and wanted to give it some time before I reviewed but now I can barely remember what happened. It just seems like its biggest issue is being boring, and I never thought Id sat that for a story based in this world.

Dont waste your time,So when they did the medieval seal/coast guard training that the men of the west apparently do I turned it off. Series is awful.Writing is just bad. Its barely inspired by the books.Directing is to self indulgent. We have to spend to much time with dramatic music while we watch a big cgi scene. Whose main purpose is look we have a big cgi backdrop.So apparently orcs have creatures that can burrow miles in a day. Um why and how does that make sense? Pretty neat that some creature the size of a small bear can dig through rock faster then a modern machine can do a subway tunnel.There are many examples of this. Apparently gandalf fell from the sky and has no ability to speak.Moria was well done in previous episode.

Terrible telling of Tolkien Lore,"While the visuals are stunning I am sorry but this is not Tolkien and not middle earth. They really just ruined the characters, in to make their female characters seem stronger decided to exclude any sort of team work and camaraderie. If this were not marketed under the guise of Lord of the Rings it might have been an ok fantasy show (if you like a huge dose of politics in your escape). Unfortunately putting this into lord of the rings and not bothering to follow any semblance of how Tolkien described the numerous creatures of middle earth made this a very unpleasant watch.The Elves are not majestic and breath-taking and really just seem to be like any of the other races of Middle Earth.On the whole this does not have the same wonder and magic I experienced when reading the books and when watching the movies from Peter Jackson (well at least the first 3).This was absolutely terrible and I cannot understand why so many reviewers on IMDB actually find it good, I really wonder if some of the reviews are being tweaked because I read them before watching this and the reality did not bare any semblance to what was described in so many reviews here.",jessewansbrough,2,0.25,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
Well below average,"Episode 1 presents a world it is very hard to recognise from books or earlier works in the universe.Galandriels character is unbelievable. What is her motivation? What does she know that noone else knows? Why does she think Sauron is lurking. It all seems weird indeed.So until further explanation the viewer has to wonder why she is being so strict on those around her demanding to die for a journey that for some reason can not be delayed for rest.And also wonder why her trainer didnt train anyone else as you see 5 elves getting smashed in seconds before Galandrial steps in.The only upside I could think of was the character of Nori.Oh and the two wanderes with elk horns on their back. The best scene sofar.The troll animation looked cool. But I did not watch the show to see animations of monsters. With lord of the rings expect world building. With fantasy I expect a what if set in a believable world.When showing fantasy the most important aspect is to emerge the viewer into the fantasy. Viewers has their own background in their real world. So you have to explain in this fantasy what is different from the real world. Rings of power did not suceed in that aspect. I expected long haired elves because lotr had earlier established that.If rings of power want to explain a different world setting they have to help the viewer understand why? What has changed.It could be Rings of power is aiming on bringing in a new younger audience. An audience not inspired by Tolkien. Not inspired by traditional fantasy of D&amp;D, not inspired by Peter Jacksons Trilogy. That is my only conclusion. I continued on watching episode 2...havent finished it yet.

The first episode bored the life out of me,"Ive been looking forwards to this series, even tho the trailers didnt look good. But the first episode just bored me. It looks great and on a cinematic level its top shelf (which critics love and it will probably win some awards.) but for TV entertainment its not there.I feel they could have halved the run time and lost nothing as little seemed to happen and things that did felt stretched.Now I know 1st episodes, especially in a big worlds like this have a lot of ground to lay, but with 2nd apparently slow too, I think Ill wait for few weeks and follow the reviews to see if it improves. If it does Ill restart watching.",maddocks-16760,2,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,7,14
A Visually Wonderful Boring Episode,"World building is always a difficult task in film and television so it is no surprise that a series such as Ring of Power struggles to establish itself in the lore rich Tolkienverse.The first episode was visually amazing. The computer graphics were top of the line. Where the episode struggled was character development and writing. The characters are uninteresting and boring. At times I felt myself rooting for Saurons forces to rid us of these terrible storylines.Visually: 9

I fell asleep during the episode,"As the first episode of the first season of a show that is lauded by some as even better than the Oscar-winning trilogy by Peter Jackson, it has high hopes to forfil. The trailers looked stunning. But then the episode came out, and I was very disappointed.Of course, the visuals look stunning. With a total budget of around a billion dollars and at least 50 million dollar per episode, that is the least you should expect. But not all visuals look stunning. At one moment it looks like magic captured, but a few seconds later that stunning scene (with for example the two trees) is gone, and replaced by an obvious CGI looking scene. Also with the practical side of things, like armour, things dont look quite right. It sometimes looks outright fake. I would thus say that with the visuals, it is a hit or miss, averaging out to an overall average.There are several characters introduced, with this episode having Galadriel as the main character. Unfortunately she is nothing like the Galadriel we know and love from the six movies (Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit) or the books. Instead of a wise woman that uses her magic and influence to get her way, she is now more like Xena the warrior princess. It is shown that she is a bad commander who doesnt inspire others, and - most irritating - cant lose a fight. I didnt feel engaged with her: shes perfect and always wins. That is irritating, and totally not what I expected from this character. It would have been better if they had chosen another elf for this, although my complaints would still stand then.Another character that I didnt like was Arondir, who was promoted quite extensively as the black elf. Ive got no problem with the fact that hes black, but with his acting: it is very stiff, like he has a stick up in his ass. He lacks Legolas his charisma, and seems to only have a serious looking expression.Furthermore the hobbits (harfoots are hobbits) are shown to be gypsies. Bad, dirty, stereotypical gypsies. And that rubs me in a bad way.The story itself is very slow and totally not engaging in the first episode. I even fell asleep! That rarely happens with series, so the fact that this happened says enough for me. I did finish the episode later, but still couldnt really get into it. It doesnt feel like Tolkien. Hence my low score.",monnikje,2,0.4375,No,A Shadow of the Past,7,16
This should not have had the name Lord of the Rings in the title.,"This series should not have had the name Lord of the Rings in it. For several reasons.Firstly, it is an original story not based on Tolkiens book, and with poor continuity in regards to the lore.But this would not be a bad thing, if the story was well-written - and the story is the weakest point of it all.Their writing is so weak, they cannot even write Galadriel as a smart character; in order to make her appear smart, they have everyone else behave dumb.The acting is often sub-par. The story is bland, uninteresting and has plenty of plot holes. The quality of the costumes is average at best, with some incredibly baffling ones thrown in. The action sequence would be better suited in a Marvel super-hero movie than in Middle-Earth.I could go on, and highlight how contemporary ideological viewpoints have shaped both casting and filming choices, but I will stop here.This series is an insult to the source materials, a spat in the face to all Tolkien fans. I give it 2 instead of 1 due to the amazing technical aspect, but thats it. This series should not have had the name of Lord of the Rings. This series should not have had the name Lord of the Rings in it.",emanuele-ciriachi,2,0.6,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,5
wrong Galadriel!,"Galadriel is the star of the show!The character that the books describe is a sorcerer, who not only has lots of power but acts very wise.Moreover, she has this Fe extroverted and Ni introverted Intuition in the books and the peter jackson series. On this series she look like an elf yes! She does have golden hair and a fair skin, like cate blanchet! But she is more like an INFP than a INFJ ! She acts immature, and is passive aggressive !I think she should have been chosen as another elf and not Galadriel!Finally I am not satisfied with the way, elves and harfoots look on this show!

A shadow of lazy writing,When I heard that there will be a series about Tolkien unfinished Im really excited on that moment but after I watched the first episode I felt really dissapointed. I cam still remember the disdain on my face when I look in the mirror after I watched the first episode. The first half of the episode is too boring. Maybe the script or the conversation of some character was doesnt make sense. I know that the pacing of the story is so dull maybe because it must be the introductions of the all character that involve in this episode. So I will still give this series an another chance. I hope all the mistake in this episode will fixed in coming episodes.,rodingalindez,2,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,4
All that glitters is not gold,"And boy does this show glitter, but not because there are gems or precious things in it: it is polished, as you can see where the moneys been spent. Sets look convincing enough and the CGI is in the upper echelons (what little we have seen, minus the birds), but the costume department almost got as badly shafted as the script writers.The dialogue is boring and borderline generic, with weird rolling rs where they oughtnt be, and sad to say, Morfydd Clarks delivery of them is so very, very stiff. Robert Aramayo has a way of delivering his lines thats grating to the ear for some reason - the only saving grace here is Markella Kavenagh that at least seems to have been directed to put anything other than salty in her delivery.Costumes then? Instead of making actual clothes, the costume department seems to have been told that heavy cloaks (all pinned at the shoulder btw) and gold cloth can compensate for lacking shape (Clarks and. Charles Edwards especially), a unique style for their culture or even effort.I did like the look of some of the settings: the Southlands and Rhovanion looked fine enough, but Lindon with its overbearing yellow/white colour scheme was an eyesore.Music... hmm... I wasnt impressed, but neither was I disappointed. It was just... there.Random thoughts: its weird how Gil-galad has no sideburns, or how the handmaidens start removing armour and arms from the Elves on the ship sailing West (and how they all stand there, staring hollowly at nothing - no one is actually sailing the ship), or how the smoke of a burning town isnt spotted until two of the cast are literally at the doorstep of said town.I have refrained from making lore comparisons or saying this is wrong according to Tolkien, because obviously, everything is wrong here.",addecm,2,0.375,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,3,8
Rings of Power - a High school production - Again,"There were moments the show looked good, but there was also lots of times it looked fake or staged. Things were are either to clean or fake looking but because it looked off. I am currently not interested enough in the show to go back and investigate further.The acting reminded me of a high school play. There was so little conviction in the delivery of the actors lines, like they were doing a table read. I also found the dialog not compelling and had me drifting focus until I noticed the camera shooting style.The camera work is simple horrible. Not every line requires a close up of the character. I was half way through the first episode when it trigged Hey they pretty much only deliver lines to the Camera after that it was the only thing I was following. Might make for a decent drinking game😄Close up .. dialog. Drink!Switch to other character.Close up... dialog. Drink!This back and forth was really distracting.The Hobbits that are not really Hobbits had potential but they too ended up as a distraction for me as I tried to understand how big or small they are. The berry picking scene is a good example, at times it seemed like the berries looked big and should easily fill the hand of a smaller being but when they were being eaten they would looked small. Nit pic for sure but these are the things one notices when bored.Episode 1 was slow I mean really slow and I did not find much of it compelling but I did manage to trudge through it in the hopes things would pick up in episode 2. I can say episode 2 was slightly better but still not enough to make me look forward to episode 3.I might give the show another look when it is fully released out but that will depend on how future reviews from trusted sources pan out.Someone has to asking the show runners where $430 million of the reported $431 million per episode went.IMBD Please do not delete this review again as censorship really is not a good look.",thill294,2,0.375,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,8
"Beautiful, yet lackluster","While the world look beautiful and the cinematography was amazing. The original characters and their roles and motives are well below average in the fantasy genre.This episode 1 was a dealbreaker for me. The pacing was to slow, they introduced way to many characters and storylines that quite honestly lacked in both exitement and diversity. All characters feel like grey mushed together actors with no diversity among them in the motives department, the onöy diversity was in the universe race categories, Elves, dwarves, harfoots and men.Quite frankly, this episode was one of the biggest dissapointments ive had in recent memories, i was really looking forward to it but the writers failed to excite me.The only good thing was the cinematography, with amazing scenic shots and good angles (even here its clear they tried to mimmick peter jacksons feeling for the Lotr and hobbit trilogy) yet thats a positive, its sad they didnt take the same approach in storytelling and characters.Truly dissapointing. So far this show is not making good use of the appendixes.",victorzaddou,2,0.4,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,5
Poor Effort,"Almost everything about this is poor:<ul><li>acting: melodramatic, on the nose, over the top - unbelievable.</li></ul><ul><li>photography and direction: lightning straight out of a cheap soap opera, shot composition very lazy with a lot of soap stares - two actors in the shot not facing each other, staring off into space.</li></ul><ul><li>script: all over the place, no rest or time to settle in this world, dont start us off with an overhead montage voice-over, it takes the audience out of the story.</li></ul><ul><li>dialog: you have to earn lines like: Beauty has the power to heal the soul.

Oh boy....and I really really wanted to like it!,"Tolkien would have thrown himself out of the window before he had written dialogues like that. Nothing feels like LOTR here.But the greatest weak point are the actors. So far I have not seen a single character with charisma who can carry a scene. First I thought that Galadriel could have been cast better but at the end of the first episode I had realized that she is actually the highlight of the cast (so far).But....we have Afro American Elves and Hobbits now.Isnt there anybody who realizes that elves and humans and dwarfes etc are the different races of middle earth? Why do we have to mix those races with the races of our world? This doesnt make sense at all 🙈And why arent there any tall elves? They all look like 170cm tall? In the fight with the snow trolls 5+ elves do not fire a single bow and arrow shot but all get into close combat with a creature 4 times as big.The music is good.Most of the art design is really good.Visual FX are very mixed, some great, some look super bad (the elven ship for example that doesnt move and travels like a train in 2m high waves).Bottom line: its a waste of money to have bought the Tolkien and LOTR rights for this, it is completely generic and bland fantasy stuff that doesnt look are feel, least of all breath Tolkien spirit.

"These writers think theyre clever, but the writings no Tolkien","Amazon really should have hired better writers. The writing is infantile, things like the whole stone looking down garbage. They think thats clever, when in fact its meaningless. Stop hiring people more interested in ideogy than writing good stories.The CGI sets look fine, but the costumes are awful. Why are the elves wearing those odd sacks? And the armour looks cheap and plastic. They needed to hire proper armourers, its not like they couldnt afford it.Tolkien would be horrified that this fan fiction is claiming to be part of his works.Ill go back to watching Peter Jacksons original trilogy, as this series is completely pointless.",steve_greenway,2,0.25,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
Such a disappointment,"Im genuinely sad to see it has come to this. Rings of power seems to have been given to amateurs. The CGI is in places fantastic .....but all that glitter and gold will not make up for the awful acting in this - Galadriel ....completley uninspiring. No presence, no connection just the same face in every scene. What have they done to Elrond? Great warrior? Doesnt look like he could master a hairbrush never mind a sword. Ive heard tales of reviews disappearing as of late. I hope this does not happen in this case.I will say that the dwarfs scenes and again CHI are decent - however this alone will not elevate this enough to warrant any more than two stars.It feels generic, no substance and the dialogue seems to have been written by a child.",mjando,2,0.36363636363636365,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,11
"Stunning visuals, boring and bland","You have to give credit where its due. The visuals and cgi looks great, considering the amount of money theyve used it really should look like it does.But apart from the fantastic cgi I really dont have a lot of praise for the show. They really want to make Galadriel an incredible warrior, have her beat a cave troll in 3-4 moves when 5 or something other elves were flung around the room by it is just not right... But apart from an obvious agenda my biggest gripe with the story is just that its so frickin boring...I get really consumed by fantasy work like lotr, Star Wars etc. And I usually get sucked into the show/movies even if I dont like them, but this was just so boring that I found myself looking on my phone from time to time...The wars during Morgoths reign was cool, the little look on Sauron was cool, cgi was fantastic, rest of the show was dull and boring, really boring. Expected much more.3/10.",marcushhagen,3,0.3,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,3,10
A shadow of this show,"Graphics:
I believe that the most budget went to the graphics of this show. I see that they have some great 3D models and good shaders all what is expected from a modern CGI title. They fail to show us the scale of the places they draw. They could accomplish that by placing a character or a group of them in the scene itself like they do in LotR movies. You could say they did that in the mountain climbing scene but I felt the camera angle was wrong, something was off and not doing it for me.Storyline:
Few elements were taken from Tolkien, few character names, places but that is the only similarity between what Tolkien was writing and was presented in this show for now. In the first episode they are jumping from
scene to scene to introduce us with characters of the show. They introduce main elf characters, some harfoots and a man from the sky. The story did not progress anywhere, we can not see what the story will be. There is no hook to continue watching this and that is ok because the strenght of IP will make people want to watch more.But how far can they do this?Dialog:
It is bad, from the description of buoyancy to things like when they explain everything what we actually see on the screen. When they try to use higher, more complex, english in the style how Tolkien was writing they immediately repeat the same thing but in simpler words.As I said sometimes they explain everything and sometimes they tell us things like you have not seen what I have seen without any context, so you can not feel for it.Characters:
They managed to convert one of the most wise, most loved and respected characters from Tolkiens texts into somebody who is of low intelligence, senseless and without any empathy for other people in that world. From the 1st episode the only character that I felt for was an innocent snow troll that was in the wrong place at the wrong time and got killed by a psychopat. The most interesting character is someone who fell from the space and did not speak at all. If the characters will continue to behave like this I will certainly understand the context behind Sauron and why he wanted to kill them all later in the timeline - if they even keep that in the show.Acting:
I feel for the actors because they will be remembered by their characters behaviours and actions in this high profile show and the script is not doing them any favours. I will wait for few more episodes to judge acting, the script did not put their characters in any real danger or anything that would need any kind of thought from their characters so I can not yet really judge acting.",stjepano,3,0.3333333333333333,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,6
Not much Tolkien here,"I cannot fathom why Amazon chose to use the works of Tolkien as an excuse to make this show. There is very little of any of the literary works of the Professor here, only a few names and events, all jumbled out of order or warped far from their original state. The show is quite pretty at some points, but the writing of the show is sophomoric and quite frankly boring.There are moments where the main character makes absolutely moronic decisions, and I have to compare Galadriel to the character of Admiral Holdo from The Last Jedi. In many ways, this production will likely be seen to be quite similar to that controversial film I suspect.If you are a Tolkien fan, give this a miss. If you just want a good fantasy show, also give this a miss or watch it in the background while doing some housework.",thephilgore,3,0.3333333333333333,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,6
"Graphics great, storyline boring. Feels like game of thrones.","Like everyone has said, the visuals are awesome! The only gripe I have about the visuals is that because the CGI is sometimes so fantastic and magical, sometimes the actual set piece used in the foreground clearly looks like a set piece. But, thats not a huge problem.So far, the storyline is just building up, but it is very slow. Im a huge Tolkien fan (read everything of his I could get my hands on) and was excited for this, but had to watch the first episode in three or four chunks because I just didnt feel sucked in. Long scenes of predictable dialogue with closeups of faces with little expression. Im definitely not saying there needs to be more action or violence to get my interest, but the storyline needs to hook you in a deep way, and so far its felt very flat.The storyline, so far, hasnt given us big reasons to be invested in the characters. Its early, so thats a bit understandable, but there needs to be more elements of human nature or storytelling that are relatable to the audience in order to get people invested. It seems like most Tolkien fans are hooked by the graphics or just by the idea of exploring more of Middle Earth, and not so much by the actual story.",jackbufferd,3,0.25,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
Expensive fan fiction - unpromising,"CGI locations look great, but the characters are generally unlikable. The acting is one-dimensional with a few exceptions (Markella Kavenagh/Nori Brandyfoot is quite okay). All in all it seems like very expensive fan fiction.They have broken the lore of Tolkiens world in so many ways, but I would be willing to look the other way if the episode was at least interesting. It is not. Its meh at best.Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) is the worst feature of the episode. Shes supposed to be an interesting main character. Shes not. The mighty Galadriel has been reduced to being an angry ninja avenger. Yes, her feats are literally ninja feats (climbing, jumping around, slashing trolls). And she is soooooo angy. But not in a scary or nuanced way. No, shes angry just like green haired teenagers are angry, always just beneath the surface, but so unconvincing that the grown-ups must try not to laugh. Galadriel simply seems like an angry/angsty teenager - only shes several thousand years old. She really got me rooting for the orcs.Oh, and the dialogue is filled with ridiculous clichés like we leave at first light as well as fake old timey language (not to mention the horrible use of English dialects). So yeah, it seems like they hired a bunch of first year film students and gave them 60 million dollars to produce an episode. It has no artistic depth. Its all surface. A school comedy made to look like the LoTR trilogy.",vaderis,3,0.2,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,5
First 14 min were ok,"The opening narration was nice. I thought, cool, this might not be a cliched, Hollywood, woman tyranny show, but then it was.Man elves are wusses and young, and Galadriel is the strongest, mightiest warrior and dispatches a snow troll with ease as she disgustedly looks upon the male warriors who decide that she can carry the weight of the world, alone, on her shoulders, while they give up.Its pretty gross, but the special effects are nice and it makes a good show to fall asleep to.The storyline would be interesting, cause it seems to be a prequel to Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, its a boring diatribe on woman power, in exactly the place where its the most ridiculous.I kind of expected to be bad when they put a little elf girl in a sheer nightgown, being bullied by other elf girls and boys for her paper boat. It gets an extra star for allowing Galadriel to stay a girl and not a fat, black man pretending to be a woman.When dealing with Hollywood, you gotta take the wins when you can get them.",Erik_Stone,3,0.0,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,0,4

A big dump on Tolkiens legacy.,"Im going to keep this short, you can put lipstick on a pig all you want but a pig is still a pig. You can tell they sank all the money into effects and film work, that aspect is okay, but not consistent. The acting? Awful. The writing for the script isnt good either. It feels like they caked this pig with lipstick, and now the pig cant speak right because lipstick is stuck in its teeth. I dont do reviews often, but I cant allow bad reviews to be covered up, deleted or hidden. I gotta do my part here. Also, now it looks like all the black dwarves have been eradicated before The Hobbit. Im all for mixing up your cast, but where it makes sense. Why would an underground race need melanin? Theres already another race of men with melanin that could have been easily included, hire the right cast, and have it actually fit into the story. I hope Amazon Studios goes under for this egregious insult of a LoTR adaption so Tolkien can return to his well deserved rest, because I guarantee his spirit is enraged right now.",serenaalfarr,3,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,2
"Optics okay, dialogue terrible, script questionable","The setting and visuals are beautiful, at time almost feels overproduced (any scene at the Elves for example is as colorful as Samsung press release picture).Audio-wise, the soundtrack is subtly composed and flows unassumingly in the background. Yet, the dialogue is a let-down - almost any conversation that Galadriel has feels artificial and most characters come across as weirdly stiff. Almost as if they wrote the lines to convey archetypes of conversation more than actual language.Regarding world-building, the races so far are a boring, one-dimensional deviation of what they were in the books. The elves are basically humans now, except that they live for centuries, but their behavior, emotion and interests have no resemblance to the Elves of the original trilogy. The hobbits are basically uncivilized dimwits with weird accents - and of course highly ethnically diverse.--Spoilers ahead--
It is hard to say where the story will go after watching one episode. There surely are many potential avenues and branches that the seasons can unfold into (the developments around the undying lands seem particularly interesting), but what is disconcerting to me is how key scenes of this episode were handled. The fight with the ice-troll was a joke, merely an instrument to glorify Galadriels ability at the expense of the universes laws of physics, common soldiers common sense or ability all the while making a caricature of the troll itself.Arondirs introduction scene made even less sense - its as if every non-protagonist just behaves in whatever illogical way around them to fit with the story arc. A bit more GoT-like consequences of actions would be desirable for future episodes.The piercing scene on the broken sword defies any logic - tbd how relevant this was, but its another affront to the viewer desire for logical coherence.Overall, one notices the high budget, and at one episode old the show is too young to fully judge, but one has to hope that the dialogue improves, the characters receive some layers of complexity and the overall universe is not continuously bent to the desires of the screen-writers. Hopefully, the non-pilot episodes will do a better job at that, because in this current form this show only shares the names of the protagonists with the source material.",seulberg,3,0.0,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,0,3
Bad Soap Opera,This episode could have been 30 minutes shorter if they cut out all of the staring longingly into the distance. Im going to keep watching but it took me three days to finish this episode. Im not certain if the characters are boring or just poorly written. Either way this pilot is a great way to loss interest. Galadriel is interesting because she seems as bored as the viewers. The CGI at times is very good but others appears to be 2000 green screen.The landscape shots are amazing but then the director chose to use set pieces that feel small for whispering and starting at each other or into the abyss.,mbpalmore-08996,3,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,2
Not for the fans,"If youve read the books and you were looking forward to a true adaptation of Tolkiens works then there probably isnt much here for you.Its clear after watching the first two episodes that
good story telling was not front and centre. It would always come second to modernising a piece of literature that was already proven to be timeless. Lord of the rings has a massive pre existing fan base.The main character is unlikable. In the original story she was a magnificent powerful wise women. In episode 1 and 2 she is one dimensional. She is on a revenge mission as a soldier seen as wise purely by the writers dumbing down of every other character and their decisons. Its hard to respect a character who is so entitled that she only sees her own priorities and talks down to any other character in a scene with her just because she is the lead. Its lazy writing.Things dont have to be exactly the same as the books. However when every character is represented as the polar opposite of the original characters description then the preexisting connection we all had to these characters is severed. There are so many deviations to the original source material in terms of timeline, characters, personalities, theme etc that it was unrecognisable. It just made it a difficult watch compared to if it was a separate entity and its own works.Im sure some new audience members who are new to lotr may get some enjoyment out of the series. However any pre existing fans who respect the work of Tolkien should ignore or at best treat this as amateir fan fiction.Amazon had an easy job on their hands because we all wanted to see more lord of the rings.

When faced with a situation that nobody could possibly ever survive, when everyone else is getting killed, when people hundreds of miles are effected by the latest circumstances, our plucky heroes at the centre of the storm, wont even suffer a scratch. Cmon. Theres being able to suspend your disbelief and then theres nonsense so far fetched that you can never suspend your disbelief.",potaytoes69,3,0.5714285714285714,No,The Eye,4,7
Guaranteed disappointment,"After the rollercoaster thrill of the last episode, episode 7 goes back to the lame mediocrity and thoughtless script that has characterised this series. Logical inconsistencies abound. That being said, the technical aspects and cinematography remain excellent. Im remain impressed by the costumes, sets, and visualisations. Its just the script and screenplay that completely sucks.Spoiler alert .....
Galadriel now decides to foster mum the kid, who goes again through the angst of is mum dead or not. For some reason Galadriel gifts him her sword. We dont know why and what she saw in him. She had more screen time with Isuldur, but now suddenly finds hope in and bonds with Theo.Isildur is apparently dying / dead / unimportant in this episode, pretty much mirroring the series.Adar makes an appearance in the end to proclaim the Southlands no longer exist and the name has changed. His declaration is usurped by the screen that reflects the name change rather than have him utter it. Just weird.Durin and Elrond remain the only salvageable elements than swim in the spirit of Tolkiens writings. The rest of the cast could well down in the Harfoot settlements with them - Id feel nothing.",kalpesh-3,3,0.5,Yes,The Eye,14,28
How can everyone survive a pyroclastic flow?,"It was clear from the beginning of the series that the Southlands would become Mordor. But what I did not expect is that every major character would be impervious to molten hot ash and lava.I gave this show a lot of leeway in the beginning, but the sheer wait of terrible creative decisions has finally got to me. Apparently Tolkien experts consulted on this show. Maybe scientists that understood volcanology should have too. Or someone with a grade 3 education.Do actual writers exist in Hollywood anymore?

"Lazy writing, unnecessary and boring episode","The writing is consistently bad in this show, ranging from setups with no payoffs, dilettantish dialogue, unlikable characters to contradiction upon contradiction.This episode suffers from the bad writing just like the previous episodes, but it seems a bit less extreme in this episode, simply because nothing happens. We learn almost nothing new, and the only really new thing was already shown in the trailers for the show. So no surprises at all. The episode is plain boring.The character development is bizarre: All of a sudden many characters admit that they are bad. But then they go on acting like bad people. Galadriel continues to contradict herself - even within a single conversation. Neither the writers nor Galadriel seem to notice.The volcano is extremely selective to the point of hitting exactly the things the writers needs it to hit and missing all the important characters. Theres simply no good explanation for characters surviving. The writers dont even try to offer explanations. They dont care.And the whole mithril story - oh boy. Now the stupidity is taken to another level. Just stop and think about what they show you. Almost all of the plots are extremely stupid when you think about them and almost nothing makes sense if you ask any question. To actually enjoy the show and the episode you have to turn your brain completely off. The screenwriting is wholly inept and all in all we are probably witnessing the worst script of any high budget series within the last 10 or 20 years. This episode is a good example. The episode is so unnecessary that viewers can skip it and go straight from episode 6 to 8 without really missing anything. What is told in this episode could and should have been told in 10-12 minutes - not 1 hour and 12 minutes.",vaderis,3,0.6136363636363636,No,The Eye,27,44
"Cringy dialogue, pseudo profound","Bad follow up to an otherwise decent previous episode.They need to tone it down with the wannabe profound dialogue. Its embarrassingly cringy at times and doesnt serve the story to overdramatize certain moments. Overall the pacing was horrendous. I have no idea why this whole season for the harfoots was devoted to find tall Man, send tall man away and nothing else. No answers to any of the mysteries there.Penultimate episodes need to up the ante and make us want to watch the finale.

Oh no!,"After previous episode I said ok it will improve. But it has gotten even worse than first episodes. Plot gaps, no character improvement, empty scenes that lead to nowhere. Bad writing and directing needs to change in second season. I want to believe to this series but its going cheesy in each episode.How can you waste so much potential.. We have waited for so long and it is not worth it. You need to save this series before the point that you cant. It has been 8 episodes and just 1.5 episodes are worth watching.

So confusingly bad.,"Ive really tried to like this show. It looks incredible and has some great actors, but oh my goodness the writing and plot are just unspeakably terrible.Characters change fundamentally from one minute to the next, say and do things which are not only objectively ridiculous, but flatly contradict what they were saying or doing a few minutes ago.Nobody talks, they just speech at each other. Their lines dont flow one to the next, they fight for attention. No one seems comfortable with the dialogue, with the exception of Durin, Disa and Elrond.Its still possible to enjoy it for being a depiction of something almost but not quite entirely unlike Tolkien, and ultimately I will of course watch every episode because I am enthralled by the power of the ring just like everyone else, but I will probably turn into a wraith as a result.Best hope is that Amazon hear and listen. The writing needs to improve.",mac-215,3,0.7738693467336684,No,The Eye,154,199
Written by 12 year olds for 12 year old casual viewers,"Some of the CGI looks good (not all) and some of the music is excellent (not all).But the writing... Wow. This is some of the worst writing of any high budget show out there. I wont even go into how this episode, like the previous episodes, destroys everything Tolkien to the point of sometimes reversing Tolkiens points 180 degrees.Even without taking Tolkien lore accuracy into account, this episode is extremely stupid. The plot is stupid. Characters act in stupid ways. And the dialogue is beyond stupid.There are some speeches and monologues in this episode thats supposed to be really powerful. But the writing is so amateurish it becomes laughable. Some of the lines have already become internet memes.But the writing is bad on many levels. Things that really, really need explanation are not explained at all, while characters will spell out the most obvious things as if the viewers are complete idiots. It is all a matter of convenience for the writers: When they need a person present, the person happens to be there, just because. Secret passwords are being guessed out of nowhere, just because. Sometimes orc can handle sunlight, other times they burn, just because.Nothing is being motivated at all. There are no good setups and payoffs at all. Sometimes there are setups and no payoffs. Other times there are payoffs with no setups. Its like the writers never took a writing class. The result is that we dont understand the characters and therefore dont care about the characters. They remain unlikable, especially the main character Galadriel.This episode should be used in writing classes all over the world as an example of all the typical rookie mistakes of screenwriting. Its amazing that this is the most expensive streaming series ever. Absolutely amazing.",vaderis,3,0.5,No,The Great Wave,2,4
cliche,"The best word to describe the episode is cliche. I try to forget relation with tolkiens world but every episodes getting more and more cliche. When i am watching this episodes i can figure what is next. I think scenarist are lazy and dont bother about what is going on. This tv serie isnt about tolkiens world. I understand that but i dont want to watch cliches. Lots of good thing about cgi,place,shooting technique but you dont worry about what is next.If you have enough time for boring and predictable show you can watch this show for art.

Sigh...,"Just stream of consciousness reactions after watching the episode:There was one scene that was genuinely interesting, but even that turned to the cliche by the end. This episode was a step backwards, in my opinion.This show continued to contrive conflicts and resolutions out of nowhere with almost no setup (and thus, almost not payoff). We have a moment that is meant to be somehow meaningful between a parent and child, because (as the show tells us twelve seconds before it resolves the conflict) the child wonders about the parents approval/disappointment. This isnt something weve seen building, its introduced immediately before its resolved. Before you have any reason to even care, its over. The music suggests the scene is *supposed* to have some emotional weight, but it ends up being a giant so what that uses screen time to accomplish nothing.The show throws a myriad of these low-stakes conflicts, or tension between two people just so theres tension between two people. Something we never cared about before, or saw before, introduced moments before its resolved, so the audience has zero investment and doesnt care at all when the resolution comes.As weve seen in the other episodes, the show acts like there are stakes, acts like those stakes are supposed to matter, and then almost immediately resolves whatever supposed conflict supposedly existed.And instead of focusing on things that would impact the larger world, we have Oh... did my friend keep something secret from me? Then we have this secret to be a secret for three minutes, and were supposed to accept that as compelling storytelling. Or, lets have conflict between two friends that we had no idea were friends, dont act like friends, and seem to actually *not be* friends, but since the show told us they are friends, I guess thats drama.The level that things happen at in this show is will I find a bag of food? or will I find a piece of paper or will I get hidden in this bush before I get spotted? The heroes and villains succeed or fail based on dumb luck or unfortunate timing. Galadriel lives or dies based on whether or not she happens to run into a raft in the middle of the ocean, Nori succeeds or fails based on whether she can stay hidden beneath a sheet, Elrond succeeds or fails based on whether he hears children reciting a rhyme or not.These are not strong characters that determine where the plot goes, these are characters that are driven here and there by silly little machinations of chance. Its all so amateurish and unengaging.In no way is this structured anything at all like Tolkiens writing (not in any meaningful way, at least--there certainly is flat out copying here and there). But, even aside from not living up to Tolkien, its just poor writing.And Galadriel doesnt behave like someone 1000 years old, she acts like a 22-year-old with almost no life experience, let alone *centuries*.Halfway done... well see what happens next episode.(The one good scene was probably the best scene of the show so far, though.)",bradclayton,3,0.4444444444444444,No,The Great Wave,8,18
Worst episode yet.,"So god damn maybe flaws in this episode... Lets begin with the visuals! Elrond with stubbles and red shaving bumps, his wrinkles, giant ears and elves looking like old men with plastic ears.Then theres the writing... Elrond being banished by the dwarfs and then walking around them like he pleases. Orcs that miss more than stormtroopers does, and when light comes up they dont even have ranged weapons anymore. Around it being let go, but hey, heres all your weapons and why dont you go past the city where your flirt lives on your way home 🙄
Cant believe the writers think that the viewers are THAT stupid. Terrible show. I even picked up my phone multiple times, thats how boring it is. I wasnt event invested in the chase by the orcs and I was right. No one died...

What is going on here?,"I have not read any of the tolkien books but I am a big fan of the movies. My knowledge of the corpus is limited. I do not know the names of the cities, their history. I dont know how the characters are processed in the silmarillion, their personality traits.However, I can tell if a character is well written or bad. Unfortunately all characters are very poorly written.It is not believable that Queen Miriel, who was stubborn in her decision throughout the whole episode, suddenly changed mind. I see her logic but its not enough to make me believe that.A lot of stuff like this makes the show mediocre.",hbasricoban,3,0.5740740740740741,Yes,The Great Wave,31,54
Best episode so far... but still extremely incoherent and inept,"This is the best episode so far, mainly because there is less dialogue and more action. Not that I prefer action to dialogue: Its just more difficult for the writers to mess up an action sequence. The action sequences are okay-ish, but not exactly what you would expect from the most expensive series ever made. Armor looks cheap, fighting style is ninja Hollywood and everything seems a bit fake. The writing - especially the dialogue - continues to be extremely bad, and this episode is plagued by the same problem as the previous episodes: Things simply do not make any sense.The show constantly demonstrates one thing, then proceeds to do the opposite. The characters say one thing, then proceed to do the opposite, and so on. Here we are not even talking about how the show contradicts Tolkien lore on so many essential levels. Im way past that and I have accepted that this show is not Tolkien at all. So the inconsistencies are internal to the show: The show sets up one thing and then ignores it afterwards. Its like they hired a bunch of writers who didnt talk to each other at all.For instance we have the orcs. Sometimes they can tolerate sunlight, other times literally burn like vampires. Suddenly the orc army is huge, but then suddenly its not really huge at all. Suddenly one orc is a better warrior than Arondir or Elendil himself, but then suddenly the orcs are so weak that peasants can kill them with a stick. Suddenly orcs have no weapons. And so it goes on and on. Its all a matter of what is convenient in the particular scene.Time and space is another issue. Nothing related to time and space makes sense. Things that should take days take hours or minutes in this show. People and entire armies teleport to whereever the writers need them to be for whatever reason at any given moment. I challenge every super fan to make a timeline of events in this show. You simply cant. But you should be able to do it because alle the stories are connected through the meteor.There are so many unbelievable, contradictory and plain stupid things in this episode that you have to turn off your brain to not go crazy. Nothing makes sense when you think about it. A sword hilt that is the primary object so far (like the master ring) is switched with an axe and nobody notices. Ask yourself: If you were handed the most important object - a sword hilt - wrapped in a cloth; would you check that it was actually the sword hilt? And would you be able to notice that it was actually an axe? Could you tell the difference by the shape and weight? Of course you could. Next thing, peasants and an elf (who also told us that hes a peasant) makes an entire stone tower into a deadly booby trap within a couple of hours. We dont see how, but the entire tower is literally made to rest on a single rope, so that when the rope is cut, the entire tower falls. Its insanely stupid. But the stupid goes on and on. The villagers left their village for safety at the fortress with the tower: They literally said so in a previous episode. In this episode, however, they decide to leave the stone fortress for safety in their village. Do you see the problem? The show does this over and over again. It reverses everything all the time. In this episode Isildur says that he left Numenor because he just wanted to get away and that Numenor is not really Numenor anymore. In the previous episodes he said that he wanted to be a valiant soldier fighting for the glory of Numenor. The inconsistencies never end. Its mind-boggling.I wont go into the amazingly stupid plan of Sauron to build a dam hundreds of years ago that can be unlocked by a magic sword-key so that if you spend years digging tunnels just the right way, water can flow into a volcano causing it to erupt. And please dont even ask the question why Adar searched for the key to unlock the dam instead of simply tearing down the wall of the dam by force (remember, in this episode a single elf tore down a stone tower by shooting a rope with an arrow). I mean, he used years and hundreds of orcs searching, when he could have just have the orcs hit the walls of the dam with a siege engine. A single ballista would have done the trick nicely. If he didnt have a ballista he could just have the orcs use pickaxes on the wall for a couple of days.There is one good thing about the episode: When the volcano finally erupts, almost all of the poorly written characters die: Galadriel dies, the Queen regent, Theo, Single mom, Arondir, Elendil, Isildur, Halbrand and so on - they are all struck by the pyroclastic flow of the volcano; a brutal mixture of rock fragments, gas, and ash that is around 1000 degrees Celcius. This is clearly shown. So they are vaporized, melted, burned and gone. All of them. And if one of them managed to be vaporized, they are choked to death by the toxic gasses. So they have a survival chance of zero percent.But somehow I have feeling that in episode 7 we will probably learn that they are not dead after all. So we will have yet another huge inconsistency where the show demonstrates one thing (they die) and then goes on to tell us the exact opposite (they live).",vaderis,3,0.6381322957198443,Yes,Udûn,164,257
I tried to love this show - but it totally failed now (even though there are good things in it),"I try to love this show and I was ok with the first number of Episodes being slow - Tolkins books themselves are often extremely slow and I saw this in a way both as a reference and a build-up for more. I also accepted the proto-Hobbits, which are not the same as in Tolkien, they lack the realism and come more across like funny creatures from a childrens book.I waited for the first Episode where things would happen. Well, this one was the one.There were some really good things in this episode - the horse chase between Galadriel and Eddar (until Helbrand appeared out of nowhere from the opposite direction, without any explanation how that was possible), the music and quite a number of shots, which reminded me a lot of Excalibur, a film I love and hold dear and I like to see the authors taking inspiration from it.The best thing about this episode (and maybe about the whole series so far) is the silent ambiguity of most characters. The Harfoots are too sweet, but they seem to be ok to leave anybody weaker just behind to die. Galadriel is the force of light, but the way she exposed herself in the discussion with Eddar nearly made her look racist and for sure not fair. Eddar is the next best thing to Sauron we have so far, but his way of thinking is not at all only selfish or evil and I admit as I viewer I can follow his train of thought the best.But then there are all these scenes with Isildur, which are just dripping of too much greasy meaning and pseudo-philosophy. This character is a shame, there is no depth in him - same way with his father and most of the Numenoreans. Why? This is just sad.Next are the plot holes: the Numenoreans riding in full gallop to a fight of which they were not informed it takes place. These are the same people which were criticized an episode ago to be too dumb to hold a sword, who are no killing masses of Orcs. They all come from an Island but they are great riders.The Southlanders leave a fortified castle behind to defend themselves in a village - WHAAAAAAT? What What What? What?? Who wrote this? Who thinks that I would take this show serious after such a scene? The Southlanders also cannot distinguish Orcs from men, celebrate a triumph without having their enemies counted it seems (as the Orcs attack with large numbers just afterwards).And then the activation of Mount Doom. Man. That was dumb. No explanation, no master plan from the forces of evil. A key is found by chance by a good guy, the bad guys get information about it by chance, they only get it into their hands by accident and then a guy who has no clue about what is going on puts it in the right place and boooom.It is clear to me now, that this show is not thought through at all. They paid a lot of money and but for sure not for the writers. This is so sad to see, I am deeply disappointed.I hold it for the show that it doesnt try to imitate Game of Thrones, but unfortunately it doesnt manage at all to be anything on its own. It is just forgettable.",gema-1,3,0.5528846153846154,Yes,Udûn,115,208
"Oh my, it just gets worse...","I tried to give this series another go and watched all the episodes I had not yet seen. I shouldve known better than to waste my time on it, because it doesnt seem to get any better, but instead gets worse by each episode.To be utterly honest, the latest episode (episode 6) is the worst so far. The writers seem to have no respect to Tolkien at all and try to cover the weaknesses of the story by special effects. Why couldnt Amazon hire good writers? They couldve easily found better writers with the amount of money they put into this series.The special effects are - once again - simply amazing, but thats just not enough to impress me. I am worried about people saying how good this series looks, because too many reviewers pay attention to the CGI and forget that its the script and dialogues that matter, not CGI.I think this series has been created for children and teenagers, who are easily impressed by CGI and cant concentrate on character development, because its clearly not aimed at thinking adults.The scene with the volcano is simply ridiculous, because no volcano explodes that way (have the writers ever heard of the laws of nature and physics?). The scene with Xena the Warrior Princess (oops, I mean Galadriel) standing before the ash cloud at the end is so amusing in its silliness that I laughed out loud.Sorry, Amazon, this is the end for me.

"Stupid writing, nice CGI scenery.","I dont understand why people are praising this, the writing is awful.First of all, abandoning a fortified castle to turn it into a trap. Ok, sure if you decided to not stay and fight. Thankfully the trap seems to work and killed all the baddies, but then all of them seemed to have miraculously survived without any further explanation, you just have to accept it.Oh, and the people who fled the fortified castle to avoid fighting still stayed to fight but out in the open...The perfect timing of Numenorians and Galadriel riding in full galloping across middle earth unknowingly of what is going on, ends up at the exact right location at exactly the right time. What a neat coincidence.The leader of the bad guys, Adar (not Sauron), is caught. But nooooo dont kill him! Lets keep him alive because of reasons... And how did he suddenly escape in the end? Did he bite his own hands of?Last but not least, how come not a single character felt a difference and checked the folded package, Arondir had been handling this quite a lot before this and never ever reflected about the sudden change in shape, size, weight and point of gravity? No, lets just assume you have the right thing.Anyhow, it doesnt matter because sure enough all of the characters in middle-earth died at the end of this episode.

I hoped you would be good.,"Since the series was announced, I hoped it would be good, when I saw the trailers and was unamused, I still hoped it would be good, and when it released and I saw the first episode, I knew it wasnt good.The finale has some positives, mainly the visuals, overall, the series have some really great CGI, and production value, but without much effort, it all falls apart, writing, the main piece that brought this world to life, is the piece that fails us the most. Its been 8 1-hour episodes and I still dont care about 95% of the characters on screen, scenes are structured awkwardly, plots develop in an untimely and artificial manner, nothing feels truly artistic and enveloped in love to the original work.The sheer amount of references to the original work makes me cringe at the moment, and now we even get lines extracted from the movies, usually people say Show, dont tell but this show has been all about just tell, even plot twists end up being almost useless, since you see effects or answers to plot twists almost immediately, everything is at the same time too fast and too slow on this show, we lose too much time in useless scenes, and important things happen way too fast, everything seems lost and confused, and the final product you get is an extremely convoluted mess.In the end, youre not so good as you think.",Takasu_,3,0.5238095238095238,No,Alloyed,22,42

Slightly Better than I Expected But Still Bad,"I was touched by the crafting of the rings. Tolkiens legacy hasnt been destroyed by this show thankfully.

It meanders like the rest of the show but finally did accomplish tying a few threads. It shouldnt have been eight episodes later though to feel like something is actually connecting.The Stranger has to be Gandalf. I dont like the backstory approach they gave him.

Last episode dissapointment,"So we come to the last episode were we were supposed to get amazing revelations and amazing plot twists only to find that those revelations and plot twists were entirely foreseeable, not just from episode one but from before the season was even shown. For example, it was incredibly obvious from the pre season trailers who Sauron was. I wont reveal spoilers to anyone reading this but you probably know anyway. Because its so so obvious, Subtlety and cleverness was not in the critical skill set of the show runners or script writers.And so we say goodbye to a completely wasted promise as the most expensive tv show ever made bows out like a deflated balloon. So much wasted potential.",potaytoes69,3,0.5,No,Alloyed,3,6
Less than mediocre,"Well, the imagery and scenery are probably the best part of the episode. Its kind of jumpy with not a lot of positive to it. Music is ok. The Dwarves seem ok so far and are believable and likeable. I do have some questions maybe someone could answer. If Saurons mark is for orcs and other of his minions to follow him, why was Galadriels brother marked? And how was his body recovered? Why does the camera move the the dagger Galadriel carries so often and why does she use it to point to the map she is reading? That seemed forced and strange. If the Harfoots migrate around, why is it they say they dont see strangers often and wonder what is out there if they move around so much? Does the King of the Elves have the authority to send Elves to Valinor? It sounded like this was a gift from the God(s) of this world. Why do none of the Elves including Galadriel have sideburns? Is this just because of poorly added prosthetic ears/costume or is it a genetic issue? They all look strange because of it. Anyhow, the script is not good, acting is generally poor minus the dwarves. I hope it improves. More to come....",cirfindil,3,0.5,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,2,4
It sucks. Get over it.,"The episode was extremely rushed. Galadriels failure to alert her fellow elves about Halbrands true identity was simply incredible - in the original sense of the word (not credible). Further, the idea that -- within *this* narrative, not Tolkiens original -- the elves would nevertheless continue the project of constructing the rings or, rather, not destroy them immediately thereafter after Elrond at least has figured things out (having found the scroll), is also silly. If ring production was just about saving all the elves from decay, then why just make three, then? What need, moreover, is there to additionally gain spiritual power over the unseen world if the metal alone does the healing/preservation work?I also fast-forwarded through the overly-long Harfoot farewell scene. Amazing, too, how our Wizard regained full mastery over the language just after the combat.The show needs new writers. The tropes used to try to delegitimise the shows critics just arent credible anymore, if ever they were.",exmach,3,0.6294117647058823,Yes,Alloyed,107,170
Not the worst thing ever but not very good,"This show so far has been all sparkle and no substance. It looks great, has good music, great production design and value, but is severely lacking in pretty much every other aspect. The frustrating part (for me) is that every episode so far has had at least one interesting thing happen that makes me go ooh I want to know more about that, and then the other 80-90% of the episode is boring, trite, cliché, predictable, and very corny. I dont even blame the actors, who all seem capable (except for the actress who plays Galadriel whos seemingly unable to move the muscles in her face), it seems to all come down to the mediocre writing.On a positive note, this episode had really the first scene that I can recall really feeling like I was in Middle-Earth (where Elrond is talking with the king about the tree). Even though none of what they were saying really made any sense, the setting and the dialogue felt right for the show. Other than that, every bit of dialogue was very cliché and cheesy.This show really feels like its more geared towards older children/teenagers more than adults, in the way the Hobbit movies were. In this episode, as soon as I saw the wolf tracks when the hobbits were walking, I said oh the wolves are going to attack them and then wizard man will save them at the last possible second and then about 40 seconds later thats exactly what happened. Just a lot of very basic bland unimaginative writing.I understand this show is a slow burn and theyre setting things up for multiple seasons. I understand they have to go over thousands of years worth of history and theres a lot to establish. While I understand this, this show seems to go absolutely nowhere every episode. I really dont need a big epic battle or a balrog on the screen to keep my attention. I dont need this show to copy the movies - Im fine with a divergence in tone/story and I dont have an issue with them detaching from the lore; It just seems like nothing in this show is moving anywhere.This show feels much closer to the 8th season of Game of Thrones than anything else, and if it wasnt connected to Lord of the Rings then Id probably say it was worse. I know Im not the only person whos still only watching this show because I hope something Lord of the Rings-ish that Im actually interested in seeing will finally happen... until then, it seems this show will continue to be disappointing.",raccoonfan69,3,0.5555555555555556,No,Partings,10,18
This episode was objectively bad,"What was even going on during this episode? I think the writers just think of really cool scenes they want to film and then work out the illigical events that lead towards it.But, all the absolute boredom aside, the way you know the writers are awful is *drumroll please* deus ex machina!!!!! Generic chase scene, generic saviour, generic escape. Amazon need to replace the writers for season 2 if they want any chance of redemption from this mangled mess.Still hate the Galadrial character too, there are no redeemable features to her.The only interest I have is the dwarves but it is so badly written with knock off Elrond even those scenes are a snorefest.The conversation between Galadrial and definitely not suspicious Halbrand was cringe too. You can tell the writers have no idea how to write dialogue and the attempts to imitate tolkien fail so hard.",ben_jarmin_4,3,0.6119402985074627,No,The Great Wave,41,67
"Best episode of the show, still not good","This is the first episode where actually something happens.This is also the first episode where they used the music mostly right and the first episodes where some scenes were actually well written and well paced.The problem is quite a few of those scenes were basically rip offs from the PJ LotR trilogy.And there are still a bunch of plot holes and inconsistencies:<ul><li>The Numenoreans travel with 300 horses in tiny ships</li><li>The Numenoreans travel 300 miles up a river and 100 miles over a mountain pass in 2 days said, which then is shown in the show as one day.</li></ul><ul><li>The whole destroying the tower down is just to much over the top.</li></ul><ul><li>They go from a good fortified position to a village attackable from all sides without good defensive positions.</li></ul><ul><li>How did they even got out of the tower and then back to the village without encountering the orcs</li><li>The orcs seem to spawn out of nothingness without any sense how many there are.</li></ul><ul><li>The traps in the village are ridiculous you could just walk around them.</li></ul><ul><li>Before the entrapment there were much more orcs than inside the village</li><li>You could have seen humans before not just by inspecting their bodies, alone by how they walk</li></ul>And so on...",luca-lindhorst,3,0.4642857142857143,Yes,Udûn,13,28
For better or worse,"This episode is the perfect illustration of the best and worst aspects of the show.The best aspects are the visual, music and decent action pieces when there are any.It shows in this episode as 2 plot lines converge and some action finally happens. The fight choreography is also rather decent throughout the episode.Unfortunately the worst aspects of the show are also in full display in this episode:
1. The writing is bad (forced dialogues, contrived set up...)
2. The logic is wobbly at best :
<ul><li>Why leave the defensible tower accessible only by a single bridge to go to the village behind enemy lines and surrounded by hills and forest on all sides..? Village they abandoned because it was not safe..</li><li>Why was the key so important if all it does is open a dam, cant Adar find an easier way and without drawing all the attention?</li></ul><ul><li>How did the Numenorians travel all the way to Ostirith in such a short time? (There might be some time jumps but it is not clearly shown here)</li><li>Why is everyone cool with Hallbrand becoming king when no one really knows who he is?</li></ul>3. Some plot holes :
<ul><li>Why do the Numenorians rush to Ostirith when they have no idea a battle is taking place</li><li>How do the villagers get back to the village without the orcs noticing</li><li>How does Hallbrand appear in front of Adar when he clearly left after both Adar and Galadriel</li><li>How did no one check Adars package (pun unfortunately intended)</li><li>How can anyone survive the volcanic eruption</li></ul>4. The characters have no depth, beside Adar. Most are neither likable nor relatable, especially Galadriel which is a big issue for the main character (even if she is probably on a redemption arc). It might be less important in this action packed episode but it still remains an issue.All in all this episode is probably the best in terms of visual, music and action.It is however one of the worst for the writing, logic and plot holes and it doesnt help with any of the characters development except for Adar.Its a 4.",aymericdakin,3,0.625,Yes,Udûn,5,8
Just pretty scenes,The disaster shots were clearly miniature dioramas. The acting is terrible probably because the actors are confused and do not have any clarity about their characters. Totally unnecessary long-drawn scenes. I actually fast forwarded 10s multiple times and didnt miss anything. The story is nonsensical with no rhythm or logic and most of the times the characters are taking stupid decisions without any compelling reason.An army very conveniently riding into unsuspecting and unknown enemies without any strategy... utter lazy writing.IMO School kids and teens seem to be the target audience.Whats the point of spending so much $$$ for this s**t! And where did all of that go. Just pretty visuals.,saugata-roy,3,0.3597122302158273,No,Udûn,200,556
Bad writing,"Sadly this was another episode of nonsenical / non-explained action.I do get that since Amazon didnt buy the rights on Silmarilion the story is a complete different one and solely based on names and places of the LotR books (which still makes it really unlikely that a character as Galadriel would behave like she does here). But there were so many plot holes, its almost unbearable and Im kind of watching this series only to amuse myself over bad writing.The biggest issue in my opinion was the deus ex of the Numerian army (How did they know where to go? And why were there so many soldiers - even cavalery on 3 ships?). Another big thing is the way the southlands seem to transform into mordor (even more so in a fantastic world): Why would the sword lead to opening a dam? Didnt the elves build this watch tower? So why would there be a mechanism controlled by the enemy? And still, why a dam? This would only make sense if ALWAYS combined with the tunnels. But then again: Why making mount doom errupt, since it will kill everything near (not to mention that Galadriel should actually be dead too)? There would have been so many better, more fantasy (magical?) ways ti transform the landscape and to make use of the sword...and these are only the pinacles of bad writing in my opinion.",timghofer,3,0.5666666666666667,Yes,Udûn,34,60
Predictable,"How is this rated as the best episode so far? In my opinion it is the worst of the series.Everything was so predictable... For example; 3 or 4 times someone almost died but was saved at the last moment.Also, how is the army from Numenor (riding their horses as if their life depends on it) just in time for a battle they didnt even know was happening? Why the sudden haste.And why do they only focus on 2 of the 4 storylines? What are the dwarfs and Harfoots up to?I find it bizar that people ate this episode up. The other episodes are okay, like a 6, but this one is just bad.The only positive was seeing Mount Doom gloom...",daanbanaan5,3,0.6875,Yes,Udûn,11,16
Why?,"Why could they not have written a story, without the big names?They could have stayed away from the known lore of the Middle-earth.Since they dont give a s#it about it anyway, why not write something truly new and original? Now it feels like they try to push in names and characters in the story that does not fit or in a way that does not make any sense.The opportunity to make a truly great show have been thrown away, in favor of some cheap fan-fiction. Perhaps not fan-fiction, since they usually stay true to the lore of the fandom.From time it feels like this show is the studios version of copypasta.I dont know how they could save the show. But why not cancel it? You could do it mid season... why not?They did it to Firefly, and that show had some true potential. But this show I have a hard time to find any true potential in it. I can see some parts that could be interesting if they explored them. But we all already know that they wont do that.",danieljonsson-01058,3,0.6,No,Partings,6,10
The most expensive Enya music video ever,"For all the expensive sets, CGI trees, ravishing worlds and endless countries, this show is like being in a history class, speciality : Middle Earth. Whats happening may be interesting but what we need is emotion, characters interacting and developing a story. What we get is actors reciting things about what they are about to do or what they should do and its absolutely boring.The fantasy elements feel more like Narnia than Tolkien. Gone is the bold, earthy, sensual aesthetic of Peter Jackson, what we get are endless screensavers of airbrushed majestic cities populated by elven Sims.Its all so plastic, and lush, and glowing, I feel I am watching an advert for Shire Airlines. Because money cant buy personality and Ring Of Power clearly lacks one.The actors are not to blame but they all seem to be extras waiting for the real deal. Galadriel is a good character but she cant carry this show on her pointy ears.This is what I feared the most : by sniffing around all the leftover pages of Tolkiens work and focusing only on world building the show-runners forgot the essential, creating a compelling key lead hero to inhabit those episodes.So were just left with the most expensive Enya music video ever.",Couchkik20,3,0.4,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,10
Weak tea,"Neither better nor worse than the first episode.Most characters continue to be quite uninteresting if not unlikable.4 story arcs is too much to handle for these writers. The episode is quite poorly written. The dialogue seems off and the subtext is unclear: The characters simply send mixed signals - not because they are nuanced or multi-dimensional, but because they are porly written. Stone face / unhappy face Arondir seems worst, and Nori seems best. But generally speaking none are convincing.The Tolkien lore is smashed to pieces, but that was clear from the first episode. So I was willing to give this episode a chance on its own terms. But it is simply uninteresting and unengaging. Its a very expensive piece of fan fiction made by casual fans who dont really care about the lore.The CGI locations look nice, but you should expect that from the most expensive TV series ever. A lot of the characters look too clean and unnatural, almost like cosplayers. I get no sense of real metal, leather and silk. Everything looks like plastic or CGI. The dwarves were almost good, but they ended up looking a bit too much like a guy in a costume (kind of like a Santa Claus costume).The score is forgettable and I really hope Howard Shore didnt put too much effort into it. If the LoTR trilogy soundtrack is a 10 then this is a 4 or 5.All in all a very weak episode, and Im pretty sure I wont watch any more episodes. As a Tolkien fan it hurts to see what they have done. And as a busy person it feels like a complete waste of time. Its 1 hour of boredom, so Id much rather watch three episodes of Seinfeld.",vaderis,3,0.5581395348837209,No,Adrift,24,43
A billion dollar CGI cant fix bad dialogue,"Fun and enjoyable, I immediately watched it again I liked it so much. But then the problems slowly started revealing themselves and it started to make less sense. Some is forgivable. The horrendously clunky and awkward dialogue is not. This is mostly delivered by Galadriel, but not exclusively. You need characters to organically interact with one another, not talking past each other in obviously scripted lines. I hope they change the people writing dialogue for the show and choose someone who has actually dealt with other humans. Also, why does it seem like Galadriel is playing this game with a Players Guide and cheat codes enabled?",hisimperialmatt,3,0.42857142857142855,No,A Shadow of the Past,6,14

They have spent years &amp; years hyping up the public by saying this was going to be mind blowing, exciting at every level &amp; showing off those digits spent on a humongous project. Yet NOTHING exciting has happened in the first 5 episode (maybe just the very first 10 minutes which they have hooked me up with on that). I had to stop the episode 4 times because it is incredibly slow &amp; I get distracted very easily because of the useless &amp; boring speeches the characters have during the whole hour &amp; more (rewinding to parts of conversation Ive lost turned out to be a waste of time). WHERE IS THE ACTION? Its talking, talking over &amp; over.

They just cannot stop making Galadrial insufferable,"The writing is so bad. I dont care about what real world race anyone is or whatever, that is just a red herring to distract from just how awful they have written this. Game of Thrones season 8 sucked, but this is something entirely new. Every conversation is a non sequitur. Galadrial is insufferably written. She isnt elegant or strong, shes a try hard mary sue. I dont care about any of the characters. I dont care who dies. I dont care who they try and pretend isnt Sauron. This show stinks something terrible.Heres one for you, how did they just guess what the orcs were up to? Surely they would have no idea, and to come up with the answer straight from the hat is stupid. Next up is the wild adventures of a stuck up elf. I dont get it, did she know her decision from the previous episode would lead to her death? Because if events didnt happen then she would have, instead we once again have that absolutely wonderful deux ex machina. Next is the (definitely not hobits) harfoots, i dont get it, do they leave people behind or not? Because there are two bits of dialogue that directly contradict one another. I could go on and on and on. The show writers have really screwed this up, then again maybe they shouldnt have given such a huge franchise to absolute nobodies.

Should not have spent money on Tolkien,At this rate its a complete wast of money they spent to create middle earth should had just created their own world. Its boring as crap. At best its a shadow of what Lord of the Rings is. Not only did they not invest in known quality actors they elected to have terrible show runners. Its all about the CGI scenes that do nothing with your emotions creating even more disconnect to the story line and characters.Its so slow it hurts. It doesnt have a central theme That is easy to grasp and non of the characters have interesting relationships. The dialogue seem A. I. generated.

"Good show, awful world construction.","Oh yeah, this series is going down fastly. Elves too influenced by human emotions as human (I really hate how Queen Galadriel is driven by her passions in this series, when Tolkien wrote her as a leader of the High Elven houses...).Also, Halbrand seems to be Sauron too clearly in this episode (maybe in a plot twsit, they told us that he is not, and instead Sauron is Gil-Galad... I expect not much more from this series showrunners).The southern elf-human plot is completely irrelevant to me (maybe some teenager finds some inspiration in it, but Im not), but seeing that many Eldar killed by a single warg has something wrong to me.Since the beginning, the elfs in this show have acted as humans, flawed as humans and passionate as humans, and thats my main critique to the screenwriters. Humans should act as human, elfs should act as elfs (immortal, magic, angelic, eternal... you know), and not as human teenagers, driven by passions, and often too blinded by them -looking at you, Galadriel, queen of Eregion...I watch (and Ill watch whatever hapens) this show. I have a deep love to Tolkien and the worlds he created. But this is not Middle Earth. This is a Middle CashGrab Earth, building an OK story without paying its respects to the original source, while taking advantage of TLoTR fandom.Such a pity, such a wasted potential...",alaborn,3,0.4745762711864407,Yes,Adar,56,118
"Each episode better, and worse, than the previous","There are a couple individual scenes that Id consider some of the best of the series, but then there are such ridiculous scenes and dialog and developments that any other improvements sort of dont matter.The Rings of Power has demonstrated that there is almost no conversation that doesnt involve some degree of conflict between the parties--not because it makes sense for there to be some conflict, but because someone must think conflict is required in all dialogue. Two friends, a parent and a child, whatever the interaction, theres going to be some contrived conflict before RoP lets people talk to one another. And if you start to think theres been some reconciliation of the conflict between two characters, dont worry, itll be back the next time they talk.As weve seen before, RoP seems to have one story arc jump many days, if not weeks, while another one progresses a day or two, but then other clues seem to indicate the timelines are in sync. Its difficult to follow exactly how much space has passed between different scenes.And thats true of the larger plot, too. We have a demand that a meeting will be held at first light (first light seems to be a popular phrase in fantasy settings, I guess). Supposedly this meeting is going to be important, but then its entirely skipped. This is another habit RoP has: tell us something important is going to happen, or did happen, but never show us. RoP has a real problem with cutting out all the wrong parts and leaving in really contrived drivel.That being said, there are aspects of Adars character that can be intriguing, and there was a scene with the halflings that honestly had me excited for a moment (unfortunately, the ultimate resolution, and the immediate follow-up sort of put a damper on it all). Meteor Man is a strange mix of almost okay, and almost idiotic. I think they are trying to make him out to be discovering the world, but the way hes a simpleton at times diminishes the character a bit.The Numenor plot is just bad. The public as a whole is not believable. Last weeks ridiculous one elf showed up and now they are taking our jobs thread bounces to half the city wants to fight with the elf. It so desperately wants to be big and important, but the Numenor plot is a mess of excuses to show Galadriel be irritated or to smirkingly defeat lots of NPCs. And the subplots are just as bad.Im planning on sticking with it through the end of the season, but each time I watch an episode, I feel like I need to go watch something good to wash the terrible writing off. I rewatched the Bridge of Khazad-dum scene from The Fellowship of the Ring, and it made me sad that RoP is so very, very much worse than what it should have been.",bradclayton,3,0.6078431372549019,No,Partings,31,51
"Not as bad as the previous episode, but nothing exciting either.","Still a filler episode, nothing really happens.Certain plot points still raise questions. The actions and reactions and change of minds are still questionable.Some of my problems regarding the previous episode, about Celebrimbors motive, is kind of solved, not satisfyingly, since new problems rise.The characters obviously have better obvious options to achieve their goals. Youll wonder why are they doing what they are doing. Like Tolkien said, Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. Those were happier times.The conflicts feel so forced. Amazon had to invent a lot to create the conflicts but failed to make me believe any of them.",quengoldo,3,0.5271317829457365,No,Partings,68,129

It is So Slow,"After 5 episodes, the total screen time is 5 1/2 hours long. And yet almost nothing has happened. Everyone talks slowly or takes 5 pauses in one sentence. What few action scenes there are cant go more than 3 seconds without going to slo-mo. And the conversation between Galadriel and Halbrand with the back and forth quick shots of close-ups of their faces was amateurish at best and laughably bad at worst.If they needed this amount of time for character development, theyve wasted it because I dont care about any of these vapid, one-dimensional characters.

No action - boring story,"There is no action in these episodes. The story is terribly boring, No acting talent is required because there nothing to act out. This is just an exercise of script reading while wearing a costume. I feel foolish for giving this 5 episodes to entertain me. It fails miserably. There are plenty of characters. How many seasons will it take to help me get to know them? Give me a Lord of the Rings conflict. Give me a battle that must be fought and won. Give me insurmountable odds. Give me a hero.

Monotonous,"Just boring.There is little but none action, scenes and conversations are too long and make you sleepy.

Since episode 1 we didnt get anything from his characther. Wolf scene - unnecessary. The whole Harfoot migration could and should have taken less time in the series.You know how boring the series has become when its Friday and youre not in a rush to see the new episode (its Monday when writing this and watching it!).

A whole lot of not a lot,Am really starting to see that a huge budget does not make a good show. Maybe it will all come together. Theres not one cohesive story so far. Maybe they will all mesh and make Sense. Hopefully by the end of the series. Everyone seems to roll there rrrs for every r. Dont remember that from the lotr films. But maybe I should watch them again. Would probably be a better use of my time. Maybe aragorn should be referred to as arrrragorrrrn. From now on.

Extremely boring,"So far I gave the show a 6/10, this episode really does not deserve such a high mark.Galadriel is saved by the Númenóreans, as any thankful person would do, she screams at them to give her a ship. She is a terrible character and I cringe every time she gets screentime.The harfoots for me is the most interesting storyline, while its moving very slow, Nori has a sense of wonder that fits in the world of Tolkien.And then there is the other elf, who is now captured by orcs. In theory an interesting concept, but the actual thing we see on screen is terrible. Elves are meant to be fast sure, but these combat scenes felt like they came out of the matrix.Combat in the movie trilogy felt grounded, rough and dirty. But this scene was just bad.

"Improvements, but not really improved","Well there are less plot holes in this episode, but still enough. Acting got worse not better. Dialogs arent better either.

They try to reveal stuff which is already obvious, they try to setup mysteries which are obvious and/or uninteresting.The Hobbits just get worse every Episode, now they are heartless little lemmings I guess, I thought their hearts are even bigger than their feet?Galadriel is acting weird, hostile, angry even more than before. The actress cannot even transport gratitude over the screen.I think it is unnecessary to point that out by now, but nothing about this show is Tolkien.Still much more to complain about, but I dont seems this show bothers so whatever.

Not improving,"Im finding Galadrial behaving like a stroppy child increasingly irritating. Im also getting annoyed with the disjointed jumping between separate stories that dont form a coherent whole, as well as the complete illogic of having close communities that dont leave folk behind leaving folk behind. After 3 hours of most shows or films - The Fellowship of the Ring for example - you could summarise the story so far, this is a bit of a mess. The dialogue is also bad - Galadrial not only behaves like a child, the mean-girl lines shes given dont help.

Worse so far,"Im trying to give this show an honest viewing and a chance. There were aspects of the two previous episodes that were good and some that annoyed me.This one did it for me. The complete mashing of thousands of years of timeline is nauseating.Why did they cast this lady as Galadriel? She is so one note, completely outshined by everyone else on screen. She has the look and thats it, and sadly I dont think its just poor dialogue. The horse scene was pointless and just dumb. Isnt she trying not to get caught? Oh lets get her the most white horse and let her and Elendil Gallup down the cost line. Ive already given up that they really dont care about her actual story of being a well established enchantress, married, has Children, and is still very ambitious in her pursuit of evil and her own realm.CGI and fight scene just badNumenor visuals were lovely, thats the only reason this gets three.Honestly dont know if I will watch anymore. Even if you didnt know the lord, objectively this show is going down hill. Could it make a comeback? Maybe, doubtful.",doulakarenback,3,0.6590909090909091,Yes,Adar,29,44
Galadriel still acts as the villain,"In the third episode of Rings of Power, called Adar, we dont meet this Adar fellow until the last few seconds of the episode, and only see him very blurry. I do wonder why they called this episode after him if hes not in it. They could have better called it Númenor, since thats the main place this episode focuses on.We see how Galadriel and Halbrand are brought to Númenor by Elendil, who had picked them up. In no way Galadriel shows any gratitude for him saving them, and when shes in Númenor, she only antagonizes the queen-regent. She only starts smiling when riding a horse in slow-motion. I dont know why they did that either: it just seemed like filler. And it looks like she didnt really know how to smile. I must say that the actress acted the angry Karen perfectly so far. I found it quite telling that Halbrand is a lót more charismatic than Galadriel. In the end she learns in the library what the Sauron symbol means: the Southlands, which we all know and love as Mordor. So there was some progress for Galadriel, although not much. Ow, and she tells a lot about Númenor. Why cant they just show, not tell?We also follow Isildur, who we know from LotR will famously not destroy the One Ring. He is apparently a dreamy rebellious son who doesnt want to do his rites.We also get to see how Arandir, who was captured previous episode, is put to work by the orcs, along with all his fellows from the watch. Quite an inefficient watch they had, if all of them were captured and none were able to escape and warn the other elves, like was their job. I still think Arandir has a stick up his butt, since the orcs have more clear facial expressions than him. One by one all his elven friends are slaughtered while they try to escape, but in the end it fails, and Arandir is taken to this Adar fellow we hardly see.The harfoots are similar in this episode like the last one. They are not that nice to each other during the migration, as you dont have to expect any help when you are injured or get left behind. And they still look so dirty. I guess they really have to learn to take a bath. The story here only progresses in the sense that they now learn that the skyguy is there, and he helps our wounded friends by pushing their cart.The visuals of Númenor look nice, I can give them that. But their armour is also plagued by the cheap-look.In the end the story hardly progresses.",monnikje,3,0.6530612244897959,Yes,Adar,32,49
"Unjustified hero, rac!st hobbits and more","First.a Are we supposed to support this Galadriel even if her stubbornness comes out of feelings and no reasonable argument? Why are all the others wrong and shes right? Just because? Cant the show even act as if she had trouble fighting? She needs no effort to kill a massive monster. A hero that is just invincible is always boring.Somebody explain to me how people in the same tribe can be totally Caucasian and others totally black. Dont they mix? Isnt there any interracial relationship? And where have the black hobbits gone at the time of The Lord of The Rings? Will they be killed off in this series? Yes, Harfoots are hobbits, one of the three kinds.How can a couple see each other and not let a smile out? Are we supposed to believe they feel anything for each other?A bar scene? Really? No creativity at all? A guy entering a bar and being stared at? Is that the Middle-Earth from Amazon?Im trying to give it a chance, but wow...!!!The three stars are for the mostly good visuals.",jonasarjunior,3,0.45454545454545453,No,A Shadow of the Past,5,11
Galadriel is extremely unlikable,"So Galadriel is aggressive and unpleasant in pretty much every scene. The only scene she smiles is really creepy and makes her look like an orc, I dont get it. It lingers for like 10 seconds and is clearly put there to make her likable.The only part that was kind of interesting was the elves in the prison camp but the orc designs where just lame and really shows that the budget wasnt used used effectively. At times you can see the actors bare arms under the costumes without a lick of special effects makeup, making them look like people larping.The only good part of this episode is the inclusion of Isildur and his father. The actor that plays the father is very good, and the character is likeable with a sense of weight and inner conflict.This show somehow makes the Tolkien world feel small and one-dimensional. Remember in LOTR how the fellowship had to actually travel to get somewhere? In this show, people just teleport hundreds of miles in between scenes without any time passing, its insulting.The harfoots are just plain silly and somehow downright evil, leaving the last caravan to fend for themselves just because. This after having a long drawn out speech remembering the people they have lost(that we dont even know or care about).It really pains me to keep watching this show at times. The main problem being Galadriel and the overall lame and lazy writing.",bobbyem-1,3,0.7183098591549296,Yes,Adar,51,71

By far the worst,"Cringing acting and a whole episode filled with predictable tropes and uninspired dialogues.The episode only picks up at the very end. Everything else was lost in useless exposition. In a series of this scale, once you reach episode 5 and the epic tone gets lost like this is sad. And every single time I see the hobbits appear on screen it reminds me of how many good actors are out there looking for a job that would have made these characters more believable.Plus, how have they spent 30 millions in making this episode that remains a total mystery.And the soundtrack also (plus a song) is not that creative. They could have explored a bit more instead of coming up with themes that have to be LOTR fitting.Another episode like this and I will stop watching.",crazyivanlupi,3,0.6534653465346535,No,Partings,66,101
Nothing happens AGAIN!,"I have already written this show off as a hack job, but I cant help but want to see how bad it gets. The issue is its so bad, so boring, that Im floundering even doing that.Please, for the love of god, fire these writers before season 2, you can still save this show!!!!!!!Galadrial is unbelievably insufferable, she has no struggles what so ever, shes the best at everything, she can defeat every obstacle with absolute ease - this is terrible writing. Only high school kids would write a character that 1 dimensional. That fight they had was unbelievably cringe.Why are the definitely not hobits always mentioning their feet? They never went on about it in the actual LotR. When they had an opportunity to have some great action, again deux ex machina- any writer that relies on such a troupe is not a writer, they are amateurs.The legolas rip off guy should have kept his mouth shut as the guy cant act to save his life.We all know who Sauron is, your efforts at subversion has failed.THE SEA IS ALWAYS RIGHT.",ben_jarmin_4,3,0.6184834123222749,No,Partings,261,422
Tough to watch,"Is there a story? It is all so incredibly boring and after 3 episodes NOTHING has me hooked.Horrible acting with laughable dialogue. Every sentence is a contest of which character can say the hardest pronounced words which is crazy to say considering the budget of the show. What are the writers doing?The show looks expensive atleast and the music is good but everything else is underwhelming. And regarding the budget, couldnt they have used some of that money to acquiring better actors and writers?Maybe Ill give it a shot again after all episodes have been released but Im taking a break as of right now.

"Do you know why a ship floats, and a mast cannot?","More stuff that happens, not because believable characters or situations would dictate they happen, but as excuses for some moment to occur.By this point in The Lord of the Rings, Merry and Pippen have gotten mischievous with fireworks and Farmer Maggots crops. Sam has rushed to Frodos defense and ventured further than hes ever been. Gimli has taken brash action. Boromir has made the case for using the weapon of the Enemy. And Frodo has agreed to take the ring to Mordor.Characters displayed their character, we knew the stakes, and we knew what needed to be done.But none of the Rings of Power characters have shown any real character (Disa may be the closest). Theres no real sense of whats at stake (other than, A bad guy might be out there) or any real compelling reason to watch.Theres more nonsensical behavior and lines that are inappropriate for the characters delivering them--an elf describing care by referencing an aging parent, a dwarf using an expression about a barking dog, detailing a tradition to a group of people that would already know the details of the tradition full well, etc., etc.Depending on the scene, Galadriel might be a fearsome warrior, or she might be warry of a handful of shipwrecked humans. Depending on the scene, helping people is just part of who the halflings are, or avoiding anyone else at all costs is who the halflings are.I dont feel like Im watching characters with real personalities. The characters arent doing anything because they have personal motivations, they are doing things because the writers need a vehicle for the next cliche.That said, I chuckled at one point during this episode, which is the first time thats happened so far.",bradclayton,3,0.6956521739130435,No,Adrift,16,23

There is no mystery here, there are no chills or small details that builds a bigger story. This series is so poorly written that I cant imagine how everyone will feel when this is all over and not a single soul will rewatch this.They are making such a blunder here when the city of numenor brings more mystery and grace than all the elves combined.

Better than episode 1,"Well this episode was an overall improvement on the first episode.The human characters, the elf Arondir and the Dwarves are good or maybe its just because they can actually act??There was actually a moment of tension in this episode where I felt invested for the first time.The weakest link in the show is still Galadrial however. Shes the worst character and the worst actor in the show but supposed to be the main character. Which could be a big problem.Will the show switch focus in order to save it? .Less Lenny Henry was also an improvement.Am I damning this with feint praise?

I think Ill stop here, because if in 3 episodes they didnt get my attention, I dont think it will be in 4. Once again, very weak dialogues. I came to the conclusion that this series was an attempt to reproduce the success of Game of Throne, only without heart and soul. I am very sad to see the loss of opportunity to make something epic and unique. They had in their hands the greatest story of fatasia that was ever written and they managed to lose it. I leave my regrets here, as I will no longer continue watching.

We are way beyond opinionated fan hate...,"This show is just so boring. AGAIN. Why? So much Why? So misguided. So many miscasts. So little tension or feeling. I do not feel rooted in the world of Middle Earth and it does not feel like I want to be. It is still very hard to understand how this much money was dropped on a show with such a bland and lost script. Obviously, the acting is a huge struggle with so much other beauty on screen... How can we even judge them for this slog. Again, LORE/Tolk drama aside, this is just a very bland, boring show. Where is the hook? Passion? Feeling? Why is our protagonist the most hated character in the show? Too many issues to count - again - not including the fan drama.Amazon... Scrap this. Now or later, this show is done.

Seriously, why are the harfoots even in this series? They are extremely dull and boring.Galadriels slow motion horsey ride. Something youd expect to see in a high school fanfic.Theyve turned Galadriel into some short tempered human-like adolescent when shes supposed to be the wisest and most powerful Elf remaining in Middle-earth. Certain shed be known by name to the rulers of Numenor, if not by face. Shes cousins of direct ancestors of the royal Numenorian line.",joeidaho24,3,0.0,Yes,Adar,0,1
Still boring,"In the second episode we get to see more of the mysterious man that had fallen from the sky in the first episode. He doesnt speak much (his only words muttered are in a strange language), but the way he talks to fireflies reminds me a lot of the way Gandalf talked to the butterfly when he was trapped. Is it Gandalf? If it is, it will be quite lore-breaking, since Gandalf and all other wizards werent present during the second age, in which this series takes place. But maybe it is Saruman anyway? Or Radagast? Or even one of the two blue wizards? Or someone completely different? At this moment we dont know, only that he acts like Gandalf with the fireflies, and draws like Gandalf.When in this episode Galadriel meets up with other people, she shows herself to be an entitled Karen. Self-righteous, demanding everything, radiating an aura of Im better than the rest: luckily she wasnt too much in the episode. I think it is quite bad when Im glad when the main character of the series isnt too much in an episode.We also see how Elrond takes Lord Celebrimbor to the dwarves, which takes up quite a bit of the episode. There is a not too interesting contest, and Elrond speaks with prince Durin IV, who is an old friend. We also meet Disa, his wife. There were some tensions between Durin and Elrond, who - like Galadriel - also doesnt act and feel like the Elrond we got in the movies (I wouldnt trust him leading armies, for example), but we learn more about that later. What I really liked about the dwarven part, was that the dwarves look and act dwarfish. I also liked the banter between Durin IV and Disa. But why o why did they have to insert a mystery box? It could be a silmaril, or mithril, but what it is, is not revealed. The suspense feels very cheap.I still wasnt really engaged with this episode. It felt boring, insulting to Tolkiens characters and himself, and the visuals are still a hit or miss.

Mostly boring,"Although the FX and the production are totally high end, the story seems to be quite difuse. Most characters dont seem to have any clear objectives, and the story seems to be fueled more by cameos than by actually character building. Some of this flaws would be acceptable for a first episode or a pilot, but having watched the second episode (and we are talking about 1 hour episodes), the show still doesnt seem to have found the right direction yet, so it feels more like a collection of cool computer backgrounds than like an actual story. Also the fact that it ignores many facts from the stablished canon makes it feel mostly generic. It could have been called D&amp;D: whatever of power and wouldnt have made an actual difference.",jdelatorre-91944,3,0.5,No,Adrift,7,14
"Episode 101/102, Lord of the Rings title does nothing for this show","The first two episodes to Amazons original series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power aired tonight and while Im sure Amazon is hoping for this to become a new flagship series, these first two episodes were just okay.Credit where credit is due Amazon clearly put in the budget here, the show is beautiful. With some great cinematography and some great cgi but at times it falls apart really making certain backdrops look quite dreadful. All the same it does look beautiful in 4k Dolby Vision. The characters are fine enough, I suppose but I have difficulty caring for them. Even legacy characters such as Galadriel and Elrond I cant care for as I did in Lord of the Rings. The acting is solid enough, I have really no complaints on performances. The musical score is fine, its not Howard Shores score obviously. But I will say there is a piece that is very reminiscent to his score and to my surprise I would later learn thats because Howard Shore did the shows title theme so that was very cool.The real weakness of this show are the attempts at being its namesake Lord of the Rings Im back in Middle-earth, but I dont feel like Im in Middle-earth. Im not a reader of Tolkiens works so granted I cant speak to book accuracy but I loved Lord of the Rings enough to do my own research on what Tolkiens vision was and what Lord of the Rings is and this, this is not it. The forcing of black Hobbits, black Dwarves, and black Elves just make no sense. Then the Dwarf women, where are the beards? That aside the biggest issue I have is no time is given to Morgoth. I may not be a book reader but I know Morgoth is key and to just mention him once is shameful and to just fast forward through him to get to Sauron is sad. For a prequel series I expected more of him and less Sauron. Now this series just started so hopefully well get more Morgoth maybe even see him but with Sauron already being the leader I doubt this.Anyway, the series just started so maybe itll get better. But if these two episodes are any indicator of whats to come I have little faith. Its disappointing because as a fantasy fan Im intrigued and it is an interesting start but when you put Lord of the Rings on it you have a legacy and a franchise name to live up to and this does not live up to that legacy.Episode 101: 4/10

Im not rooting for the main characters,"I havent read the books however I fell in love with the Lord of the rings movies. The characters were likable even lovable and pulled you in. In this series I cannot say that at the least. It is really hard to feel for these characters because there is something lacking. Galadriel amongst the many others are just not likable! These characters needs more depth to them. They need to be more relatable. Also, I feel that this series lost the essence of the elves being mystical and mysterious. On another note, whats going on with the halffoots?!? Why not just have the regular hobbits?!? I feel that some of these changes were unnecessary. I hope for next season the writers make the characters more relatable and likable. I honestly think they should bring In new characters to follow to help out with this issue. Moving forward because of all the changes I will stop comparing the movies to the show because its evident they are totally different. Yea.",lasheafletcher,3,0.46153846153846156,No,Adrift,6,13
Why cant they get Tolkien right?,"I usually try to watch something all the way through before reviewing it. Amazingly, within a few minutes of this show beginning, it demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of Tolkiens Elves and Tolkiens literary style. Tolkien imagined the Elves as a species more pure than humans--flawed, but not in the petty ways that humans are flawed. Tolkiens diction varies from the English of turn of the 20th century England (Hobbits) to a 17th-18th century English (Elves). Amazons Elves act like contemporary humans and aside from fake English accents do not talk like Tolkiens Elves at all. Its like Hollywood lives in a bubble or should I say a vacuum. Its like they cannot imagine that Tolkiens fans actually love the books partly for the language, and also for their depiction of an ancient world in which people (and Elves) were different from contemporary humans.

Increasingly boring story with nonsensical plot,"This is the 3rd episode and the cracks are really showing.It is boring and contrived.Why?Because things happen for no other reason than the plot demanding it.The orcs have enslaved entire villages, gathered strength in the southlands, dug massive trenches and razed entire forests.Yet the elves detected none of it?The elves, with their superhuman vision saw none of it from their towers?Galadriel with her century-old search for orcs/Sauron missed it entirely?Yep, because the plot demands it.Oh, and Galadriel only now realizes that the mark she has been obessing over for centuries is a map to the southlands
Why didnt she realize it before?Because the plot demands it.The harfoots make a massive 180° turn.They go from jovial community where no one getsd off the path, no one gets left behind to a brutal survivalist group
where anyone who cannot keep up gets left behind.Thats...pretty brutal.And Im supposed to care for those people?The slow-mo with a closeup on Galadriels face and horse is cringe.Im all for slow panning on visually important locations (Kaz-Dum? Great! Numenor? Great! Galadriels face? Nope)
but this is just awkwards.The elves all act like petty children while the humans are wise and collected.It should be the other way around.Some scenes seem to be missing.The enslaved elves in the orc camp rebel out of nowhere. No preparation. No warning to let us know they plan to escape.They just attack the orcs out of nowhere.Numenor remains visually stunning.Except the CGI on that wargs face.

Ill stick with it for now but I must say that I am very disappointed with the opening episode.

I have to say after watching the first episode, I have to agree with the negative reviews. The story was full of boring dialog and bad acting. The episode waits to the end for something interesting to happen. Visual effects are good. The biggest problem were that the Elves are very off-putting.

"Not great at anything, okay at some, poor at some","Frankly, the dialog, action, and storytelling are all pretty weak Were given no reason to care about anyone, were shown nothing to help us understand (or care about) the stakes, and characters say and do things that just dont feel real.Uninteresting characters doing uninteresting things while exposition tells us what were seeing is supposed to be meaningful. On its own, its flawed and rather mediocre. Put against the quality of the material thats supposed to be inspiring these stories, its woefully outmatched.I know a lot of work went into this, and the production quality is generally adequate--sometimes good, sometimes not so good--but its just not engaging or all that memorable. And while the scenery and dialog are usually okay, sometimes they are pretty bad. Anything on the water looks really artificial and clearly shot on a large water set rather than outside.The main elf characters speak in these awkward lines that are presumably supposed to sound Tolkienesque, but they end up coming out like generic fantasy analogy #6. For the same wind that seeks to blow out a fire may also cause its spread, or, Do you know why a ship floats, and a stone cannot? It might be passable in someones Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign, but it feels really amateur here.So far, its just uninspired storytelling with a good budget. If it wasnt associated with Tolkien, I dont think Id have any real reason to keep watching. However, it *is* associated with Tolkien, so I probably will keep watching (but its also probably going to be continually setting itself up against a much higher standard that its likely to meet).",bradclayton,3,0.5789473684210527,No,A Shadow of the Past,11,19
A not bad start....but weve been here before.,"Episode 1 - A Shadow of the Past.Forget everything youve known....
A young girl that is the key to everything....
Destroy the past, kill it if you have to.....The usual tropes that are here, the bulldozer ideology that have seen the destruction of franchises like Star Wars, Doctor Who, Star Trek, every comic book you have read....they are all here doing the same thing in a different setting.Its difficult to believe this series was produced for any other reason than to call its detractors names and no doubt we will be....but Im gonna give it a try anyway.I hear Galadriel is a warrior now father says the old man to the priest from across the stone wall.So after the obligatory intro of Galadriel being bullied at elf school we fast forward to the arrival of middle Earth and a fellowship that is led by our heroine who is the only member who seems to know anything of what is going on like a nursery school teacher go in search of Sauron.So after a long search they end up in Orthanc? In a fight with a Snow Troll....the situation looks hopeless and the outlook grim....then Galadrial overpowered as expected dispatches the troll within seconds of her sword being drawn.This remarkable show of strength is not enough to stop a mutiny as the pale, stale males of the company announce they are all going home.So we leave this scene to a cornfield where a couple of travellers look to be on a Harfoot hunt, but those pesky proto-hobbits manage to outwit them by hiding and we find ourselves in a Hobbitoneque scene being introduced to a diverse bunch of little people.It looks like a warg is going to cause trouble before we pivot back to the elves is a idyllic forest dwelling Lindon, capital of the high elves. Elrond the only half-elven seems to have been left out of the high council due no doubt to unpure bloodline and he is being elfsplained to by Galadriel back from her sojourn in the darklands.Back to the straight out of Donegal Harfoots Elenor Brandyfoot (not Brandyfeet!!!) and we get our first name check of our gener-swapped Bilbo/Frodo no doubt heroine to be who expresses a desire for goings-on outwith the enclave they find themselves in.Pivot to the Elven high council for a crowning session declaring days of peace where it in anounced by David Cameron 3 of them including Galadriel are going home to the Grey Havens.....she does not look chuffed at this news and after a wee emotional chat with Elrond who tries to dissuade her announces she is staying in middle Earth to chase Sauron.Onward to a village Tirharad in the Southlands, the lands of men and two cloaked figures make their way to the local tavern. One of them is revealed to be an elf, Tuvok or Arondir or something I forget which and the barkeep asks where he has been the past couple of weeks.Arondir is subject to some racial slurs about his knife ears from a young lad but it is soon over and he goes in search of the pretty landlords daughter type Bronwyn who left the tavern when he entered.Arondir and his companion get notice that their outpost is disbanding and they will be leaving.Arondir then searches out his love interest who appears to have a son with his ears overtly hidden so Im going to assume he is going to be half elven and possibly Arondirs son....but we shall see.Cue to a farmer who calls about a sick cow with black ectoplasm coming out her udder and something is afoot and our couple are off on a quest.We now go to a ship with Galadriel doing her best Yara Greyjoy impression and then to Elrond and David Cameron who turns out to be Gil-galad moaning about her going off on a jaunt when she should be mincing about a wood messing with mirrors.Back to the proto-Hobbits and Sadoc (Lenny Henry) stating to Elanor She is a bit tookish in her makeup.Bronwyn and Arondir find the village they are going to Michael? Hordern on fire after having a chat about how unloyal the townsfolk were and how she is Arondirs only kind touch of all his days in this land.Back to Galadriel who has seemingly decided to sail to the Grey Havens after all and the heavens part to a glorious light and it seems something has fallen to Earth? While we see a meteor cross the skies near the Harfoot encampment what is this wizzardry?The end scene shows Elanor finding ground zero of the meteor and a chap with a grey beard lying in its fiery middle.Ultimately.... I enjoyed this....even though I kinda didnt want to after the dreadful trailers it piqued my interest, the characters seemed curious enough for me to go onto the second episode.Im sure Im being conned in some kind of bait and switch where the big-bad will end up wearing a red cap shouting make mordor great again just in time for the mid-terms, but we shall see.4/5.",poolofzenda,3,0.40860215053763443,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,76,186
Better than first still so many things wrong...,"FIrst of all, dont see any improvments in acting at all. My biggest disapointment is still how the Elves are presented, they seem like any other human. They totally missed the mark and I see no attempt of fixing that. Didnt they have someone watching and reviewing what they were making?The introduction of the meteor man could be an interresting part but I am afraid they are gonna totally slaughter this by saying it is Gandalf.Still the best part is the Hobbits.But it got some competition when introduced to the dwarves, like the mood, the scenery.This episode had so many plotholes I really hope they are gonna fill some of those but not gonna hold my breath.The biggest positive was that this is better than Episode 1 so there is that.",hampus-berg-680-115968,3,1.0,Yes,Adrift,1,1
Not much changed from ep 1,"Music is still neither good nor bad, and the Hobbit (sorry, Harfoot) plot has barely moved along: the Stranger (this is his name in the subtitles) is busy eating snails and and for some reason, Nori thinks shouting friend! will help when he, two minutes prior, did not understand the concept of her telling him her name.We get to see our first orc close-up, and the use of make-up and prosthetics is by far better than CGI-ing them (looking at you, the Hobbit): however, with its introduction we once again get another count of All the Women Are Right, All the Men Are Dumb: its setting a trend.The episode in itself feels choppy, where they cut it up to show what happens a few hundred miles away, but then go back and pick it up right where they left off: the sense of time gets distorted this way.Were also introduced to the Dwarves and now the dialogue is turning into some political play á la Game of Thrones that does feel fitting... had we been introduced to a cast of politicians like we were in Game of Thrones: were not. We only meet Grandma Celebrimbor and a few named Dwarves (by the way, the initial Dwarves seen wobbled along like penguins - it looked hilarious, for all the wrong reasons): theyre too few to create the atmosphere they were gunning for.Theres a scene where Prince Durin and Elrond discuss the sapling the former had nurtured, and its apparently a sapling of the Great Tree of Lindon: but were never shown or told of this Tree of Lindon prior, so this line and scene carries no weight.Its one star more than episode 1, if only because theres less of a rather bitter and snippy Morfydd Clark as Galadriel. The plot in itself isnt anything special, but I am being reminded of CW shows for some reason.Also, the Sundering Sea that Galadriel and Halbrand are adrift on? Not great looking. As in it looks very very fake.",addecm,3,0.45454545454545453,Yes,Adrift,5,11
A little better...,"This episode was a bit better than a few of the others, if for no other reason than it answered a couple of questions. The writing in this series has been less than stellar and thats being very kind. Theres been little action in the series with the exception of one episode. Where there is little action in a series such as this then the story and the writing had better be top shelf to maintain interest and for me that simply hasnt been the case. The characters werent all that strong. More than anything the story just stunk. I thought the intention was not to stray too far from Tolkien and I felt they did. Sorry, but very disappointed with the series.",mjsm60,4,0.3684210526315789,Yes,Alloyed,7,19
Cheap,"The feeling im getting when I watch this show is that it feels cheap. The story, the characters, lack of origin material etc makes you feel that this is a cheap copy of true greatness that LOTR really is. Nevertheless it is the most expensive TV show ever made, and I cant understand where all that money went. That is the biggest mystery of the show for me.This final episode is no exception. The big reveals in this final episode doesnt really progress the story in any interesting way and honestly makes little sense at all. They are just plot twists to deliver some suspense in the moment but leaves you wondering, what was the point?Because the show lacks any interesting plot or character development you arent really invested in the characters or the story and when this plot twist comes you dont really care.This show is really a missed opportunity and doesnt deliver anything interesting or special to the LOTR lore and I have a feeling that the showrunners really dont about that, as long as it is profitable.",fredrikgillhagen,4,0.5384615384615384,Yes,Alloyed,7,13
What remains from Tolkien at the end?,"After seeing the final episode of the season I only feel like they went too far away from the work from Tolkien. I understand you need to make some adjustments in order to make a product into a tv show but this is way too much.I think the writting is just poor, they mix in characters they are not supposed to be there. The visuals are great but thats all: the story is made up.It doesnt respect the original so in the end buying the rights for such big price and end up doing something like this with the plot is wasting the money. I like some acting, some other not that much but none of this matters as much as my feeling is that this is not a Tolkien story: I feel deceived, much like Galadriel I suppose.",miquelcornudella,4,0.5294117647058824,Yes,Alloyed,18,34
"i cringed a lot, but at least they didnt derail any major storylines","Dialogue as awful as always, continues to be one of the worst aspects of this show along with the writing.How did Halbrand travel to Mordor so quickly?No sense of any reasonable amount of time passing for that amount of travel to be undertaken.3 / 4 harfoots gain some very convenient plot armor.The baddies about as deadly as your average stormtrooper.How did they mix the Istari up with the Dark Lord though?I didnt catch any justification or underlying reasoning for why theyd screw their mission up that badly (maybe there are some lore Im not familiar with here, I havent read the silmarillion yet).Why was Eärien, presumably one of the newest joiners to the architects guild, chosen to audition for that deathbed task?I cannot recall her having accomplished anything as an architect yet.Overall, Im so disappointed in this show (disappointed enough to write a first ever review on anything here on IMDB).A lot of the time it plays like fan-fiction more than a serious retelling of the events of the 2nd age.Adding the blue wizard is a great idea but I wish that didnt get entangled with the Harfoots storyline who was consistently the weakest throughout the season.Gil-Galad seem woefully underdeveloped.We are really lacking insight in the characters inner thoughts and the methods leading him to take any given decision (same can be said of Durin III).At this point in time I cannot see this version of Gil-Galad having the strength of character to eventually face-off with and, along with Elendil, defeat Sauron to end this age.Elendil was great.Elrond, Celebrimbor, Durin IV, Disa and Adar where also some of my standout characters.Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.",jonathanclaesson,4,0.5483870967741935,Yes,Alloyed,17,31
Was this really the season finale?,"In the final episode of the season we find out just who is who whilst the harfoots take forever to say goodbye to the stranger and that girl that found him. Some rings finally appear too...On the whole Ive enjoyed the season, but will admit that some episodes were a chore to get through, theres no way I couldve binge watched it.As a final episode it was very uneventful and quite dull, hopefully the second season will pick up were the penultimate episode left off as this episode doesnt.With a bit of luck the second season will relegate the Harfoots to a mere footnote as every scene with them drags the show down.",carry-on-man,4,0.5147058823529411,No,Alloyed,35,68
Annoyed,"This is the show that evokes no genuine feelings and the writing is so transparent your eyes keep rolling. Its the kind of show that insults your intelligence by saying: dont ask questions, just consume.Why does Miriel wear a blindfold when her eyes were not that damaged before?Why suddenly in the last episode have Pharazon mention immortality when this theme should have been woven in from the get go? Its like the writers remembered, oh shoot we forgot the immortality thing!Why did they make a big deal out of building a furnace as hot as dragon fire when the ended up in that room with this tiny furnace?Why doesnt Galadriel tell the king about Halbrand being Sauron?Why doesnt the second greatest smith in Arda know about alloys?Why did Sauron let Galadriel live?Why is it a good test of identity to ask Elrond something not commonly known? (Sauron was in her mind a minute ago and presumably heard what her brother said, so he could also know about how she met Elrond)Why didnt anyone care about Halbrand missing (and not coming back according to Galadriel)?Why is everything now connected to Galadriel? (Three rings was her idea??)Why are the Harfoots so important of they never did anything great in this Age according to lore? (because LOTR?)Why does Mystery-Gandalf says to follow your nose when he just said he needs to go east?Why did they melt all of Galadriels dagger because they needed silver and gold? But surely the blade is made from steel, right? Silver and gold are not strong enough for blades...Why did the Elves made their rings first? Shouldnt they made them after the other rings because they saw the need to protect their realms from Sauron?What was Halbrand-Saurons plan? He just hoped Galadriel would jump from the ship so he made it that hed float on a raft in the middle of the ocean with other people?And why did he pretend to be the king of the Southlands? So that he could join the war, get injured so that Galadriel takes him to Eregion to heal so he could influence Celebrimbor? What a convoluted mess of a plan!And how arrogant to rewrite Galadriels story in a way that her lines later about her being a dark queen was all about her romantic interest in Halbrand/Sauron?This show is so uneven in the tonal shifts between a Disney death scene of Sadoc who doesnt feel pain or goes pale because of blood loss and cauterising an wound in closeup with blood gushing out of it.Its so stupid that elves that look like Mr Spock want to look for ancient documents in catacombs. But catacombs are burial sites, not a library!I dont care about these Hobbits. If they did anything of note in the Second Age, Tolkien would have written about it.Why do the writers need to be everywhere first? Nori made Gandalf who he is... it was Galadriels fault that Sauron knows how to craft with mithril/Mordor was created
Nori was the one who saved Gandalf from evil Maia witches?Galadriel says her line about a queen because Sauron wanted to have her???Celebrimbor has no power.. like an eunuch apothecary.And forging of the rings didnt seem magical somehow. Upon finishing the rings, Celebrimbor smiles like he is petting a kitten. What a weird casting choice. We didnt even see the dwarves constructing the forge tower!Theres so much wring with this show its very hard to put it all down: all elves dying until spring is completely wrong, Sauron turned evil because Galadriel didnt want to be his queen? Jesus!Plus the whole season we had to endure this completely unnecessary Gandalf origin story just so they could have Hobbits in this show. And Gandalf. Because people know them.The writers change everything about this story but then have Gil-Galad randomly walk his spear Aeglos around. What? You want a pat on the back for that? Nevermind that it made zero sense that he just walks around with it in his ceremonial garb.Its and empty show made by inexperienced people that have the audacity to change Tolkiens lore to make it more boring and derivative and pretend they care about the books.What are we expecting at this point from season two? That they copy more cool Peter Jackson scenes and inject themselves in the lore?No thanks.",vsek,4,0.6842105263157895,Yes,Alloyed,13,19
It led to this?,"OK, its been obvious from episode 1 that this show is at best average with its pretentious dialogue, hammy acting, an incredibly annoying lead character and very poor writing but now that the first season is over the question just has to be what was the point?You would think that after the tedium of the previous 7 episodes that the pay off for having to suffer all that boredom would be an exciting conclusion with something important happening in grand fashion. It turns out not. Its just more boredom with more tedious dialogue and Galadriel has her jaws wired shut most of the time and shows less emotion than a boulder.This show needs to improve drastically because if the first episode of season 2 opens with more of the same its toast.",pjdickinson-27822,4,0.6550724637681159,No,Alloyed,226,345

Lets see what develops!It did bring up many interesting questions though! Who were those three initially mysterious and eventually nasty ghostly women?

Far Too Slow,"This show (and especially this episode) is far too slow and meandering. I can only wonder as to where all the budget went because Im sure most of the scenes could have been shot in front of green screens with CGI backdrops added later. We would be no wiser. Im sure we are all supposed to listen intently to the dialogue and soak up the atmosphere but for me its all very meh! I couldnt care less if everyone died of the flu because Ive been largely unable to form a bond to any character. Sad really because I really wanted this to be the pinnacle of Lord of the Rings storytelling. Oh and while Im on a rant, why is every scene so dark?

"Udûn was a decent episode, so of course this had to fail","With Udûn, I was starting to get some hope. Maybe the show is heading in a slightly better direction ? Well of course not, how DARE we ask for two back to back episodes that are actually good?Lets start with the shows strongest aspect, usually the cinematography, the red color practical effects are creative, but not realistic, or aesthetically pleasing or horrifying to look it, it fails to communicate any kind of emotion or feel. Just a shame really, because you can tell that is the kind of praise they were banking on for this episode to carry, one of atmosphere and fantastic camera work, but unfortunately it simply does not hit any kind of emotion within most of its viewers.Dialogues are still nowhere what we expect from this universe, certainly nothing that even come close to comparing to J. R. R. Tolkiens writing. Acting however is not bad, Daniel Weyman as stranger is showing great range and Robert Aramayo has been consistent throughout the entire series. Tyroe Muhafidin also deserves some praise for portraying what I think is a very difficult character to act out. The actors are good, well most of them anyways , but the material simply does not allow for them to shine as much.Overall Ring of power continues its streaky and inconsistent ride, lets hope it ends well at least...",abirzenith,4,0.4090909090909091,No,The Eye,9,22
So many things that didnt make sense.,"I have liked this show up until now, been nice with some more fairytale fantasy drama.First thing, this episode was more dark, and I missed the Harfoots.Second, nothing really made sense, why leave a fortified tower, to try to defend a village. How did they make the trap on the tower that only required 1 arrow to destroy half an army?When we see Numenor out in the sea, its sunrise when they still are about 1 hour from shore. When the orcs take the tavern its still nighttime. How did Numenor know they had to full gallop to save the village? They had to somehow know that the village was in trouble, or they wouldnt had galloped and tired out the horses, especially since its a forign and quite possibly a hostile land. How did they make it in time?And how did our King of the South start after Gladriel when they were hunting for the sword, to somehow end up in front of both, so he could trip the Uruk?",joakimhagensen,4,0.6,Yes,Udûn,12,20
I still just dont care about anyone (cept maybe Adar),"This show is an aggregation of individual scenes with really no greater whole. Cliche after cliche, characters without solid motivation, and a general smallness to it all.Were still mostly caught up on little things like if someone finds a trinket, or whether or not seeds will heal a wound, but this episode did get a bit bigger, albeit in some sort of nonsensical ways.Theres a whole collection of things that really dont make any real sense if you think about them at all, and I suspect the writers are relying on you to only consider the immediate moment +/- about 10 seconds. For example, please get excited if someone rides out of nowhere to save the day, and please dont at all ask how they managed to warp three miles ahead of everyone just so they *could* ride in and save the day. Or look at the spectacle and please just ignore how physics and nature might work. Etc., etc. Plenty of Deus ex machina stuff here.However, its still the most interesting episode so far, despite the nonsensical stuff. You really have to ignore a lot of basic storytelling, but if youve made it this far, I suppose this episode is a high point...?

As soon as I see her I want to fast forward.Most of the episode was boring, at some point they even had a jump-scare, perhaps to wake up those who had fallen asleep.The ending scene though was great. And if that scene had not happened, I would have tuned out after this episode.The white tree losing its leaves and the message that went with it, as well as the consequences of this moment made for a few interesting scenes.It was the first time in 4 episodes, I actually felt some excitement.",Dondergod,4,0.2727272727272727,Yes,The Great Wave,3,11
Why show the great wave,"The downfall of Numenor should be the climax of the later season/s of this show, yet we get an explicit vision of it here in S1 E4.Therefore:
1. Worst case, the showrunners will not actually destroy Numenor in the end / drown Miriel.2. If they do, as the appendices demand, they have robbed us of narrative tension by already showing it. They have also taken away the horror of Miriel realising her and her peoples doom.3. The show takes away the concept of free will by making the fall predetermined, when so many events lead up to the flood/sinking of Numenor, including the slow rot of corruption by fair seeing Sauron, should be a lesson in the multitude of choices to turn back and change course that the Numenoreans had on their tragic descent.I gave the show 4/10 stars because despite this and a fairly plodding pace, the dwarves are a highlight of the show thus far and because there was not a Harfoot in sight this episode, thank the Valar!",deanof-67346,4,0.4,Yes,The Great Wave,4,10

Its fine to have episodes where you set up an action piece or a big developments on the next one, but you cant justify an episode where nothing happens. I am enjoying the show, but please give three good seasons rather than five like this.No issue with reinterpreting the Silmarillion, go with what you have.

mixed bag. Not good enough at this stage.,"I was drawn back by some positive reviews, only to realise theyre probably fake as they all use the same buzzwords and didnt match my perspective (or anyone else I know who are actually watching it).The plot is actually coming together as in a storyline is actually developing. Its still not believable though. I dont have to force myself to suspend my disbelief while watching the movies or reading the books or watching other fantasy series such as House of the Dragon or GOT or even Wheel of Time. I can only put this down to poor writing and acting. Its so hammy. Once again Galadriel is shown to be a poor vehicle for this show. Shes an unbelievable and unlikeable character, acted badly.By this point we shouldnt all be thinking Well they need to find their feet and set up the world and other thoughts to justify this meandering show.

The ending of the episode has south lands disappear and morder flashes on screen. Something about that seemed so cheap and lackluster.

Getting really worried-,"The story didnt really develop at all. This and previous episode could have been just one. Actually all 5 episodes couldve been 2 episodes. It is too slow-paced.. and I havent developed any feelings for the characters. Five episodes in and I think thats a big red flag. Makers of the show try to add in too many characters - and fail to make them enjoyable to watch. Though I do like Durin and Disa. Lotr was spectacular, all the actors did magnificent jobs and the story really pulled you in. Rop just makes me feel annoyed and frustrated. I tried not to have great expectations but this episode especially made me consider not watching this further. Ive read the books and really love the lore and I just feel as though they couldve and shouldve done a better job. With the price tag - surely. So far I feel like the showrunners just made this for families with small children. It mightve been a good idea to listen to scholars and keep in mind the people, fans of tolkiens(and jacksons) works - those who most waited for the show. I wont start to pick the whole show apart but lastly I must say that Im deeply sad how they decided to show elves - none of them have that eerie-vibe, they do not act though as elves. The short hair was a clusterfu*k. Galadriel is written so badly. Shes just like some wannabe hard ass detective that weve already seen so many times on cheap tv shows. I do not think the actress is bad perse - but she doesnt feel like Galadriel. It is very hard to take these actors seriously. And I knooooow - its a fantasy. But everything so far feels so trivial.",aaltonen-silja-m,4,0.6,No,Partings,12,20
Beatuiful but confused,"Incredibly hard to believe the lack of creativity the people in the Southlands have in this episode. They can imagine only two options: fight or join... what about flight? Also when half of them decide to fight, how are they lettings those who want to join Sauron (become their enemies) do so with impunity?Galadriel is probably one of the most unlikable characters Ive seen on television. Nothing about her portrayal is interesting.Ar-Pharazôn seems to take after his uncle Tar-Palantir in the way his memory is processed. In one scene he quite nicely justifies his support for leading Númenor to Middle-Earth. In another he seems to completely forget his reasoning as he sows seeds of doubt regarding the expedition after a ship was destroyed in the harbor.The elves reason for needing mithril is ridiculous. In no way does it align with any of the literature, which isnt a surprise but the explanation for this adaptation is laughably absurd. I hope that Durin has other plans than accepting the demands of Elrond. How else could he possibly seem to accept the fact that all his doubts about Elronds intentions would prove true.",mouiylus,4,0.6595744680851063,Yes,Partings,31,47
No. Everything is based on convenience and lucky coincidence. This is not good writing.,"The first two episodes were good, the third was terrible, and this one is as well.The Elrond and Durin part was fine. The Arondir and Adar part is not. Good acting, but then Adar lets Arondir go with his weapons. Why? They show Adar caring about orcs and then he lets Arondir go with bow and arrows, meaning he will kill more orcs? Why? And the scenes afterwards are pathetic. The two boys go into the village with the sun. The sun goes down at exactly the right moment, what a lucky coincidence. Then, exactly when the kiddo is going to be stabbed, Arondir saves him. What a lucky coincidence. They escape and exactly when the kiddo falls, the mother arrives, what a lucky coincidence. The escape from the woods and the sun rises again so the orcs stop, what a lucky coincidence. Everything happens because of luck.Its the same problem in the previous episode. Galadriel is saved by a ship captain friendly to elves, what a lucky coincidence. She escapes frome the guards and who does she find? The friendly captain who is immediately ready to help her, so they go to the library, and there she finds not only the meaning of Saurons symbol, not only Saurons plan, but also the meaning of Halbrands medallion. How convenient is that?This show has got two enormous problems: the terrible personality of Galadriel and the fact that reality bends around the plot, when it should be the plot that has to be influenced by reality.Dropped.",gabrielebursi,4,0.6296296296296297,Yes,The Great Wave,17,27
Losing momentum instead of gaining it.,"Im sorry but this show is losing any possible momentum it had from the first few episodes. Even if I try to look past all of the weird writing choices, like harfoots chanting no one walks alone while leaving someone behind because they are injured.... for just one example, even skimming over that, the show is incredibly boring right now.Nothing that exciting is happening. No characters intrigue me enough to care what happens to them. I just also feel like Galadriel is such a terrible lead. Again not even getting to weird writing with her, just her on screen presence and how interested I am in watching while she is on screen, its like a 3 out of 10. I just dont care.Look I love this type of fantasy setting. I eat this stuff up. I consume everything I can get my hands on that is even remotely fantasy. I love it all. So yes I will watch this show to see what happens. But you are kidding yourself if you compare this to GoT early seasons or even the peter Jackson trilogy in terms of quality. Those works are miles and miles above this show. Sorry Im dont ranting. It just irks me because they are spending so much money on this show to make something that is just flat and boring.

When Plot armour is so thick and obvious a GBU-57A/B bunker buster couldnt penetrate, you know youve done something wrong. There was no suspense, no drama. You knew main characters just wouldnt die no matter how much you wanted them to.A fireball of toxic ash and soot rains down on a village. This fireball burns and levels every tree and building but almost everyone survives. All of our heros come out of it with perfect hair and not a single burn, just utterly ridiculous and poor writing all around.

"Long, dull and inauspicious penultimate episode","Dull as dishwater episode. Its obviously an episode intended as a respite, a breather from last weeks action, and the calm before the storm if storm there is next week in what will be the season finale, but the pace is incredibly and quite unnecessarily slow. By the looks of it this would appear to be the longest episode in the season so far, but the only reason why that seems to be the case is that there is endless character development, or rather what stands in for it: endless dialogue, ponderous pontification, emoting and going through the motions of suspense.Unfortunately, although most of the characters arent badly developed by now, there are very few that we - well I at least - actually I care about very much. The Numenor crowd: not a single one really. Thats a problem because it means the suspense &amp; the emotion has to be faked for the most part. Maybe we care a little bit more about the half-foots. Maybe, but even there it hardly compares with Frodo &amp; friends in the Peter Jackson adaptations. Actually I think the stranger &amp; his relationship with the halffoots is fairly well done in comparison with the Numenor fall-out but its still drawn-out.Out of all the story threads the only that really interested me and made me actually care was Elrond and Durin, and the sub-plot about the fate of the Elves. Sure, theres just as much dialogue but here alone the drama and tension makes sense. Minor tension between father and son becomes something much more serious, with potentially huge consequences for two peoples. I actually do want to find out what happens in this story-line but thats about it.Except perhaps for the alien type strangers seeking out the stranger who fell from the skies, who perhaps we kind of care about in terms of who they are supposed to be.Beyond that there is no action. A non-eventful orc encounter, and the only promise of something better to come in the last episode......lies, we learn at the bottom of khazad dum.Altogether a quite astonishingly poor set up for a final episode.",RetroRick,4,0.6136363636363636,Yes,The Eye,27,44
"bad, bad and bad","I cant believe it how they could do such a terrible thing to this story...they should have a secret of talent to ruin the Tolkien masterpiece. Its look like they do it on purpose. Screenplay and acting are really important for this these kinds of series even more than visual effects, but unfortunately they just spend most of the budget only for CGI and drone shots. The director has no idea what to want or should do, crews just read and play without any feeling. The only good thing about this show is just has 8 episodes, no more... anyway I give up on it and dont think theyre able to save the Lord of the Rings, rings of powers.",Ehsan11111,4,0.5263157894736842,No,The Eye,20,38
Wasted Opportunity of an Episode,"Episode 6 of RoP was an exciting culmination of various plotlines finally connecting, but episode 7 was a lot of fluff that poorly attempted to deal with the fallout of the previous episode. Not much happens in this episode, no storyline are advanced and its difficult to grasp the purpose of watching this 70+ minute episode. As usual, its beautifully shot but it bounces around the various groups of characters haphazardly and without any real purpose.Im sure many book readers will be upset by more plot points being retconned, but the larger issue with this episode is that you could get everything you need from it in a 2 minute recap.",jjmorrison-154-177235,4,0.46153846153846156,No,The Eye,12,26
Thats the end of the line for me...,"I am not a Tolkien superfan, but I enjoyed the LoTR trilogy immensely. That was the only thing that made me watch this show and, in doing so, with each episode I was disappointed.There is poor character development, story-boarding, and pacing. That characters make no sense and lore is thrown at a pace that can not be easily digested by someone who hasnt read the books.The characters decisions do not make sense most of the time. There were several point in this episode where I felt that I was watching Dumb and Dumber. I mean, why give up a fortified position to fight in huts? Why stop someone killing someone but then try to kill the same someone yourself? What is the point of Harfoots? Why are some of the key dialogues just rephrasing of what has been said in LoTR?In closing, I gave this series a fair shot by reserving my verdict till I have actually watched a good amount of it. But alas, I have only wasted time on something that is an insult to LoTR and good TV. I hope nothing comes out of that volcanic ash alive.",deltaop,4,0.6026490066225165,No,Udûn,91,151

Not terrible but really boring,"First of: my expectations were super low and I feared something like the Wheel of Time desaster.Good things first: Galadriels actress fits better than I expected from the Trailers. I can believe her, much more than Mr. Elrond. The music is great. The city overview shots are really amazing, the landscape felt impressive, yet the Sets were too much CGI for my personal taste but I can take it. And the story was ... Okay?Leading to the negative:
The first episode felt unnecessary. A huge exposition dump without any real meaning, without really exploring who the characters are and why we should be invested into them. I mean, yea, Sauron/Morgoth and all of that, always on the hunt for the evil, okay ... But why should we bother? What is at stake, really? LotR gave us The Shire and heartwarming people we would care about when the Dark Riders come ... Rings of Power gave us almost nothing and, even worse, boring and barely believable stuff. I mean what was that prologue scene about? Why did the elve kids act like school bullies, how did they behave different from humans? They should be completely differrent societies. And these kind of errors show the whole time. Dialogues try to be epic and full of meaning but are only weird and pointless. Costumes and visuals appear to be epic on first sight but are weird or simply bad on second view (the fight on the first scenes are hilariously overacted and dont really blend together if you look closer and on slow motion).The worst thing is that nothing really happens in the first episode. Many scenes and dialogues are redundant and if we mute the music we barely feel anything (except for the cringe of watching cliche smelly and dirty humans who are mostly idiotic racists).Good thing is that the second episode starts slightly stronger and that we have no super obvious canon contradictions so far. So its probably okay if you just want some high fantasy stuff. But if you want LotR - or at least a good, tense story - better watch something else.

Made up stories and unfaithful portrayals of beloved characters hidden underneath amazing cinematography and CGI,"Where do I begin ?The fact they introduced Sauron in his wicked form, something he doesnt even acquire until the fall of Numenor? The fact that Galadriel is now suddenly a dual blade wielding warrior instead of a warrior who uses Magic and power from the Great Tree?The fact that Harfoots dont even come into Tolkienverse until the third age where they are discovered by the Dunedain rangers ? Or the fact that the video games did a far better job of showing case Celebrimbor and his persona?At least the cinematography, color grading and CGI are some of the best we have ever seen, that is the only thing this show is worth watching for.

For that much money, you would think they could afford big(ger) name actors and infinitely better writing and storytelling. I just finished watching the first episode and the characters are devoid of charisma and the writing/storytelling is ponderous and lackluster. The special effects and settings are very pretty. Sadly, I walked away from the first episode feeling like this was a gigantic gorgeous piece of junk food, and I felt rather queasy after consuming it. They should have spent more money on outstanding storytellers, the ones who know how to spin real magic instead of this drivel. Instead, it seems like they focused on all the pretty things they could make. Too much money in the budget and not enough sense.",tesharri-30001,4,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,2

There is no lore. There is no plot. There is nothing that after 3 hours makes any sense. The visuals keep the story afloat, but the major pieces arent there.

Episode 3,"I liked the first 2 episodes
The 3 episode was decent
What I really hated in this episode are the following:
1- the crown of Míriel
2- how short-minded Galadriel is
3- the sea is always right part
4- Medhor death slow motion scene was not necessary because his not an important character and it was cringy, it shouldve been a quick throat slit followed by him dropping down and the action beginning
5- Galadriel slow motion horse scene was horrible.6- the carpet or the painting was ugly
7- Arondir killing an Orc with a F***ing TWIG!!8- the orcs being to vulnerable to light is an exaggeration they hate the light but not burn from it.9- the warg CGI is bad and has human eyes and doesnt look good
10- how did the watch warden die there was nobody and he also got shot from both sides
11- Adar shouldve been revealed in this episode
12- I was hoping to see some dwarvish scenes
13- very slow nothing significant happened.",qqjtfsx,4,0.6,Yes,Adar,21,35
the show remains boring,"Im sorry, Im truly trying to give this show a chance. I find it difficult to invest if I wasnt a LOTR fan in the first place.

I cant watch another episode...this is my last one unless for some miracle I hear this show gets incredibly good, I am no longer going to continue with this. House of Dragons is surprisingly good, and thats because I probably went into that with low expectations because the way the writers ruined season 6-8 of that show...maybe amazon over hyped this show, and thats why its so bad...we went into this thinking it was going to be on par with the original Peter Jackson trilogy or better perhaps?

A slightly better episode but still a very peculiar show,"This episode is a slight improvement, mainly in my view because the Galadriel storyline picks up. She is still not really the character of Middle Earth but well acted.More noticeable to me this time was the tackiness of some of the CGI, especially the long range landscapes. Quite surprising in a show so well funded.And nothing can quite mask the overall oddness of the whole thing. It really is one of the weirdest shows Ive ever seen: I mean almost hallucinogenic at times in its weirdness.Clearly they are working on scant material in the Tolkien back catalogue. And I have no problem introducing people of colour to Middle Earth, just as I have no problem empowering and enriching the female characters. Tolkien was a (white) bachelor of his time.Which raises a central problem. Its the disconnect between this show and almost anything else that Ive read or seen about Middle Earth previously. There are a few links, e.g. Numenor, but so much of this rendition seems to have no connection to what we have known or seen before.But the biggest issue is none of these things. Its that the show is downright weird and whacky. Like it has been conceived by someone on a bad trip.",Drabble500,4,0.5185185185185185,No,Adar,14,27

A Shadow of the Past... Indeed,"For everyone who has read The Silmarillion, this intent at bringing to the screen such a deep, complex and epic mythology, will seem like a sad joke.I mean, if you need inspiration and material to build amazing worlds, complex narratives and oportunities for actors to shine in awesome roles, The Silmarillion is definately your best option. It has it all, you only need a good team and, most of all, the seriousness, commitment, dedication and sacrifice to actualize it.Amazon, John D. Payne and Patrick McKay have done nothing of this. Nothing. Its been said that this is the most expensive TV Show of all time; well, if its true, by the look of this first episode, its the biggest waste of money in TV history.Where to start?First of all: The title. Who repeats a word in the title and the subtitle. The Lord of the RINGS: The RINGS of power? Its so so so confusing; plus, we already have The Lord of The Rings, why not go The Silmarillion? Whats so difficult about that?Secondly, and now on the first episodes intro: for someone who is not familiarized with Tolkiens universe beyond The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings, it would seem to me that it is pretty difficult to understand the setting. Thousands of years before the events of TLOR, this TV show talks about places like Valinor, Beleriand, Númenor, all of which by the time of TLOR are nowhere to be seen. Why? Because Beleriand and Númenor are under water. Yes, under water. In TLOR the farthest west the map goes is Lindon (which we see in the show) and beyond that is just the sea; but underneath that sea is Beleriand, all that big chunk of land where this TV show will happen. Ok? Ok; well, people who havent read the book dont know that, and the first episode does not give a crap. There is no explanation whatsoever of where we are. Its just good old Middle Earth, only, it looks a bit bigger.They show us Valinor, the Undying Lands, across the sea, and dont explain anything. They just expect you to go: Wow, I didnt know there was more land beyond Middle Earth; well, thank you, now I know and that wont happen; if you really care about story telling, that feels like they just tricked you.Also, Valinor is where the Ainur live. Do you know who the Ainur are? No? Well, this first episode wont tell you, because apparently its not important.Saw those two big trees in Valinor? Well, they are extremly important. Do they tell us what they are? No; they just die, and it does not look like a bigger deal than just the elves losing their homes. (also, in the show, Valinor looks devasted, and in the end Galadriel and her team are going back there? They never told us how they rebuolt it, or tokk it back)The intro tries to resemble TLOR epic intro, and it fails. It does not give you substantial information, its all so general and basic: Oh, evil dude Sauron follows orders of much more evil dude Morgoth (Melkor) Then the story stays on Sauron and... yeah, Morgoth disappears; i guess he wasnt that important. Oh, there is a big war that lasted a lot, Galadriels brother is dead and now she wants revenge. Fast forward centuries... Oh, now she is older and she still wants revenge, but it seems we wonNow, the story starts and... get ready, beacuse you are about to meet a ton of different characters out of which you will probably hear the name of 5 and remeber 2: Elrond and Galadriel. The amount of characters is ridiculous, and the ridiculous short time you get to see them while being expected to remeber them while you dont even now their names... man! Its so messy and so all over the place.Two other things do not help the characters: the script/dialogue and the actors. Sorry, but its true. The only character who transmitted me a genuine feeling was Nori Brandyfoot, but it was all ruined because of her name: Nori. Why? Why? Why? Didnt Tolkien invent enough names for you? Hes got pages and pages of appendixes, why did you have to go and pick the exact same name as one of the Hobbits dwarves? Why?Also, whats up with making up random characters who dont even exist in Tolkiens world?So, dialogue and acting. Acting is terrible, sorry. I felt nothing. Galadriel does not trasmit anything at all. She needs to be angry, confused and her face is the exact same throughout the whole episode. Not a single change; she takes herself too serious and ends up looking funny. (Btw, my sister and I couldnt stop laughing the whole 50 something minutes, it was all so cringy)
Arondir, same thing. The scene in the bar was hilarious; he acts so tough, but hes acting is choppy, he is awkard with the lady there that she likes, and, oh man this was funny, the dude who gets angry at him and spalshes hes drink all over the place: its all so overly acted, it does not feel real nor natural.The Brandyfoots and company: what the hell are they? Gnomes? If so, big no no; there are no gnomes in The Silmarillion. Hobbits? Its not clear; why are there some people with antlers hunting them? (why the antlers? If they are hunting the gnomes thingies, then why are they walking around with that like tehy are trying to attract a moose or whatever?)
Again, Noris mom, and the chief Sadoc: horrible acting, overly exaggerated, its too artificial. Her dad wasnt too bad, though.Next, Gil-Galad: number one, his name is never mentioned. How are we supposed to know who he is if we do not read the IMDB credits? Number two: horrible representation; Gil-Galad is a king who is corrupt, he is blinded by power and victory and cannot see the danger he is putting himself and his people in. He is arrognat; but in the TV show he is just meh, bland, no emotion; he is not nice nor good, he is not arrogant nor decandet nor annoying; he just is; and no, he is not god, he is, in a very bad way. He doesnt do anything.Now, the action. The introductory war was cool. When I saw the eagle crashing with like a dragon, my mouth dropped. Expectation soared exponentially. But then I saw Galadriel fighting the snow troll, and I didnt know if I had to laugh or cry or through the boiled egg I was eating at the TV. I mean, it was RIDICULOUS. It looked like a ver cheesy videogame, and that type of action simply does not work in Tolkien. Maybe some otaku people were like: Hell yeah, Galadriel but not me. It was barf worthy.And the end, Galadriel going to Valinor. Wow. I dont remeber if that happened in The Silmarillion, but Im pretty sure thats not what happens.First of all, if she was so determined to keep looking for Sauron, why agree to go on the ship only to jump in the middle of the sea where no one could help?Motives are so messed up, they are not clear. I do not know what any of the characters want, exept for Galadriel but she acts like a child when trying to let people know hat she wants.Ok, I could go on, but its not even worth it.Apparently, or at leats according to the TV show itself, critics are saying this is the event of the year, or whatever. I dont know which critics. Pretty ugly ones, I guess. Cinematography, music, costume, stes: yeah, all very cool. But it means nothing if the stroy is horrible.Thats my take. And this is my first review in IMDB because I was just so mad, I had to say something.Last advice: read The Silmarillion, and maybe you agree with me.",aldiro,4,0.0,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,0,2
"A mediocre Fantasy Film, worse as a Tokien movie","It could have been worse.The writing is mediocre; the acting is average/sometimes good; the dialogue is incredibly inconsistent.Galadriel is unlikable and brings down every scene she is in. She feels one-note, with no depth beyond her need for revenge at the cost of everything else. According to the film, she has been carrying this vendetta for hundreds of years and I cant imagine a less interesting person to be around; a void of hatred and nothing else.The Dwarves were better than previews and articles would lead you to believe, though the lack of female beards - and some other presentation - marks them out as clearly not Tolkien Dwarves.The Elven hairdoos werent as distracting as I thought theyd be, though it does make the characters feel less magical. Indeed, the Elves feel a lot more like humans, as a whole, than Tolkiens Elves - which were more than just humans with pointed ears in his fiction.The Harfoots are okay comic relief and often charming, even if they feel tacked-on. I dont understand why they never bathe, though.As for the misplaced racial diversity - its honestly more annoying when youre thinking about how its all politically motivated than it is in the film. The POC actors are as boring and lifeless as everyone else, so nothing is gained or lost. Lore! Lore! Lore! I get it, but we live in a global community, now, and have to accept that mandatory diversity is part of our new paradigm.Overall, the series deserves a 5 - straight average - but it gets a point knocked off for failing to adhere to Tolkiens lore.",maehedrose,4,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,3
Mediocre series that struggles to capture the attention,"Overall mediocre. Not a copy-paste of GoT into LoTR lore, thank god. No nudity and little action. Thats a plus. But the overall quality of writting and direction is lacking. And this is very far from Tolkiens original lore, so take this more as a fan-fic than anything else.The visuals are amazing, and really help set the tone. However the costumes look cheap and do the exact opposite. The elves in particular look like cosplayers. Galadriels armor looks like it is made of the same tin I use to cook my pasta in. Eldrons cloak looks threadbare. The elven haircut is horrendous. Long flowing elven hair? Nope.The dialogue is subpar. None of the elves speak like elves. Why would you write them to use contractions all the time? Dont do this sounds so much worst than Do not do this. The elves basically break immersion whenever they are on-screen which is some 40% of the screentime.Worst, there is no subtelty. Everyone tells everyone else exactly what their arc is. Nori tells her mum I want to see the world basically verbatim. There are ways to make us understand without telling it to our face. Show dont tell is underused here.The characters are hit-and-miss. Galadriel in particular is the equivalent of a Middle-Earth flat earther. She believes Sauron is alive in spite of finding no trace of him for centuries. Why? She seems angry at everything and everyone, is dismissive of Elronds advice and doesnt seem to even care for the safety of her fellow squadmates. She has very few to no redeeming qualities. The actress looks the part but cannot project gravitas or authority which, again, breaks immersion.The music is very tame. Doesnt really add or detract from anything.In terms of plot, very little of significance happens and a some of it shows a lack of care for the finer points of writting a cohesive story. Special mention to Galadriel jumping from a ship while in the middle of an ocean. Shes dead. RIP.I half fell asleep during the episode, but at least it was recognizeable as Tolkien-ish. Hopefully the next ones will pick up on the plot on move things forward.",Rafario,4,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,1
Boring and left checking my phone for the entirety,"I may exclaim that for someone who doesnt use their phone often to check social media, I was left overwhelmingly bewildered by dialogue and the pace of the which it introduced the plot and setting. I my self have only seen Peter Jacksons films of the lord of the rings and the Hobbit which I both loved and returned to middle earth for this story from Amazon that seeked nothing but to be something it wasnt and to achieve the success of the game of thrones(Which I also greatly enjoyed). But perhaps in simpler words and in shorter sentences, the first episode just was just not cool. Comparing to the hobbit or the lord of rings which I understand they were not trying to mirror, we were introduced to vast castles and villains standing on volcanos. We are instead greeted with a scene of Galadriel being bullied to only be met by her brother who is not named and some truly ambiguous dialogue that followed. Rocks looking down, ships looking to the light and me not giving a care in the world. Whilst fans of the show will say it is philosophical, I find it hard to retrieve any actual meaning out of it except that the show is trying to be something it is not.However, one thing that did save this episode and indeed the the following episode was the visual effects and cinematic shots which were outstanding and completely rip apart the idea of TV budgets. Although whilst the cinematic shots captured your attention for only a few seconds, the story line still lack lustred any real progression or sustenance. I found the characters boring, the narrative slow and lacking any real logic in the dialogue. It seemed from the outset that Amazons idea was to pour money in to series and hope for the best which I wont say has completed failed yet as this is only the first episode and intentively hope it gets better but viewers must be prepared for what is undeniably a boring one hour episode.",TheMasculineMystique,4,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,2
"To be the most expensive series, it has flaws","I watched both episodes, but couldnt help but compare them to Peter Jacksons movies. The performance is somewhat empty. The Elves lost that mystery, (removing their pointy ears) I feel like they are people from the Roman Empire, rather than beings that are immortal with thousands of years of experience. And the story, at least so far the weak one, compared to the other works, the acting and the dialogues are far below. The cgi is superior without a doubt, but I dont understand how in the movies of 20 years ago, the cgi is not so far from the current series, knowing that there is more technology and a tremendous amount of money was spent. I should feel like WOW, but it really didnt. Well see what the next chapters hold but for now, Im more hooked on The House of the Dragon.",festgarcia,4,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,5

Certificate 15?Soon realise why when an orc slits a mans throat in a far too graphic way.So no longer family viewing: not showing my 12 year old that.Totally unnecessary.Amazon must be mad letting this happen. Why let viewers think that the level of violence in the first 2 episodes is fine then crank it up massively in the third? Chopping a monster to bits is fine but watching someone bleed out after his throat is cut is way too gruesome for children.Will have to preview the next one before letting our lad watch.,johnmtownley,4,0.34210526315789475,Yes,Adar,13,38

Release the ChihuaWarg!,"My overall rating of the show is still around 3/10, but this episode introduced new characters which I enjoyed watching and Find Intriguing. That being Elendil who looks pretty cool I must admit and I am intrigued to see how his story is handled.I liked the hobbits up until this episode, but them abandoning their injured makes them seem very uncivilised and barbaric. These are not herd animals but supposedly inteligent beings. Also what is it about not letting strangers in? How did they become so multicultural then? The writers apparently never had any of their ideas challenged.Galadriel is still unlikeable. Acting like an entitled rebelious child half of the time. Do they realise that she is about 2000 years old at this point? Yet Elendil compares her to his children. Yes Galadriel is younger in the second age then she will be in the third, but she should be already mature at this point. NotSauron, sorry Haldebrand is pretty alright in this episode, though they are litterally ripping of the Aragorn character arc.Last but not least, the ChihuaWarg! Who came up and who approved that character design? It looks like a bad taxidermy of a Chihuahua crossed with a boar. If that was the intention, then good job I guess, but why? The scene is then untintentionally funny instead of being suspensfull. The Drama of the Arondir part is also badly handled just for the sake of Drama. The problem is, that they have to put down a tree to dig a ditch and the Elves take issue with that (while being totally OK with carving statues into live trees but I digress). And the Orcs make a big deal of not going around but cutting the tree down... but then later in the episode they zoom out and you see the ditch is pretty curvy already and they easyli could have gone around the trees, would even take less time than to hassle with putting the trees down and dealing with the roots. So the whole conflict was just fabricated filler.Come to think of it, I feel this episode is also 3/10 at best, but I like Elendil, so I will leave it as is.",tommy-97761,4,0.5,No,Adar,1,2
"Better than the others, but sadly, still not very good.","Theres less out-right nonsensical stuff in this episode, and less terribly-inappropriate-for-the-setting dialog, but you still mostly get things that are setup just to look a certain way onscreen, or to seem like something significant on paper, rather than as part of a compelling story.Galadriel still has no real range of emotions (despite a rather awkward moment). Theyve managed to bring in some new cringe lines, and what are we supposed to think about the halflings? This show thinks that if they throw in a random conflict out of nowhere, then have a character overcome it in 10 seconds, its showing depth--but it just feels so very shallow all the time. Forcing yourself to be compared to Tolkiens beloved writing certainly doesnt help in that regard, either.Things dont seem happen in this show because they are reasonable or plausible, they happen to be part of really weak setups for just as weak payoffs.This episode includes some development with the elves that requires the audience to either forget that elves supposed purpose in the South lands, and/or just accept that these elves are sometimes just completely incompetent at everything they do. Then we get some contrived moments that, presumably, are supposed to be impactful, but since the show has spent zero time setting up any sort of connection with the involved characters, it comes across as entirely meh.Multiple characters engage in a number of interactions that fall apart with the least of scrutiny. But because the writers choose to employ some cliched and uninspired solutions, we get to watch characters behave in silly ways to create silly conflicts, so those silly conflicts can be overcome with television trope #16, or 23, or 8.That being said, we got a little action, and some plot motion, kind of (and another cringe line that has no place in a Middle-earth setting, but oh well at this point).",bradclayton,4,0.0,No,Adar,0,1
Do I really need to watch few scenes?,"The series lacks severe footing for now. The previous episode showed something interesting and they decided to go with a different characters life line in this episode. Which is good when there is much to show, but the story fails to engage.It just feels like they are making sure the main characters do not die, not by their luck or victory, but because their enemies are more generous than them. The leads are arrogant, while the orcs are like, okay lets not kill him and take him to the king. Like what? Dudes he killed more than you and your friends, and you want him to live while some people you killed did not even bat an eye towards you.The main frustrating scenes for me where when they decided to show some slow moving scenes like the riding on the horse back along the shore. Really, is it necessary for me to watch this? I agree it was visually good, but did you really need to drag it for 30 seconds, you could have showed me the plot a bit more. Explained a bit more on the characters mentioned.The show is still missing a character like Grandalf.",deepak-32317,4,0.0,Yes,Adar,0,2
Good looks vs bad writing,"This episode is fully packed with action. A fight chases another. Its the first time in the show where it doesnt feel slow and boring. Also the cgi and the overalls of the fight choreography is great.The episode really looks absolute stunning, but even tough the fight scenes looks good, they lack of life. It doesnt look like the characters fighting for their life in battle, it looks to plain and it makes no sense at all how they fight and what moves they make.<ul><li>Why does the Orc not having a sword when attacking Arondir?</li></ul><ul><li>How can some farmers fight against a whole army of orcs and man?</li></ul><ul><li>Why is the tower falling down when just one rope is burning?

High paid producers, directors and a lot of writers said and thougt - Yes, thats a perfectly fine scene for the show.The Rings of Power is an entertaining Tv-show when you dont ask questions and just want fast, stupid, good looking action with famous namedrops from the Lotr world.For people who like writing, good dialogues, and at least some kind of sense then watch HotD!",Haeusi96,4,0.6,Yes,Udûn,51,85
"No, no, no","This has become lazy writing - why all this exposition, show it dont tell it. Basic logic is gone - how could the elves not have noticed a giant ditch?! Why is Galadriel acting like shes 17 and not an immortal being that has existed almost since the beginning of time? Why is there almost sexual tension between Galadriel and Elendil? Why do the elves look like men with pointy ears - wheres the ethereal, stoic creatures thats bestowed with eternal life (and light), that is not affected by weather and dirt in the same way as men? Im not sure I can sit through an entire season... and something is beginning to bother me - why is the cgi so inconsistent? One would think that they could manage to do a proper varge if they can do a numenor... all in all, this show was not made for lotr fans but for people who likes to just get the easiest possible entertainment... there is not a single original thought...

Good visuals but poor storytelling,"The landscapes are really beautiful, no matter if there are real or CGI.However, some parts of the shows dont make sense for me or are poorly made.A good example is the boat that navigate by himself while Galadriel and her companions stay still. How many days did the spend standing like that in tye middle of an ocean? Why no one use the system to control the ship? No food supply or protection one the boat? And the Galadriel jump of it and think that she is able to swim back to middle earth while valinor is far as Europe and America ?This show tries to look like a Tolkien adaptation, but fail to do so in my eyes.",tomaszpldudek,4,0.2,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,1,5
Not much to rave about or to root for especially if youre called names for criticism,"What do you get if you have the rights to the appendices of a book? You get something familiar but without the substance without the writing without the poetry. You get characters that dont act like themselves. Its empty and stupid sounding like a rock and a boats described differences. Then you get actors whom you have never heard off saying its the story Tolkien shouldve or wouldve told maybe if he was braindamaged. Not only that but when a shows actors have to preach about how thier show has diverse characters and if you criticise the story they call you a phobe it wont indear me to you. The Wire and Treme have been shows that were diverse and they didnt preach and they were made decades ago. Its weird and lies.This is like Zack Snyder writing Tolkien but if he couldnt even do a cool action sequence either. The acting left me cold and it was a slog to get through. This is an awful start at worst and a bland start at best. Amazon are hoping to make it about how phobic people whom dont like it are and that isnt really a successful way to gain new fans unless they are activists or make the old ones root for you.Im hoping this wont be as bad as Obi Wan, Resident Evil and Moon Knight but these two episodes were dire and hopeless. You want some recommendations for other better shows instead. Here you go dear reader: Kotaro Lives Alone, Peaky Blinders, Better Call Saul, Spy x Family, Severance, Demon Slayer, Stranger Things (Season 1&amp;4 only), Barry, Tokyo Vice, The Legend of Vox Machina, All of Us are Dead, Only Murders in the Building (Season 2 is much better), DOTA: Dragons Blood, We Own This City, Pachinko, Reacher, Prehistoric Planet, The Terminal List and Atlanta.

"Slow plot, mediocre acting, hopefully it picks up","Really, its was like having to watch something akin to a Greek tragedy in the original. Very stilted acting, with nothing much happening other than building up background to the story, perhaps thats why theres two episodes straight off the bat.The continuity of accents is interesting, although some of the pseudo Irish accents are a bit odd, but then theyre not Irish I suppose, they just sound similar to Irish to our modern ear, like the Dwarfs in the movies sharing some vaguely Scottish/Welsh sounding accents.Hopefully things change as the development is concluded and the story begins in earnest.Beautiful scenery and rousing music is not enough!",gordon-mccrae,4,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,3
Wanted to liked it,"I loved how it brings you that epic feeling of middle earth back, but I hoped the writing was a bit stronger... all seems unnatural, lifeless, boring, the characters are less than bidimensional, and I lost interest quite quickly. I couldnt stand the constant, manipulative and bland scoring. Its in every single scene trying hard to be Howard Shore, and its just annoying and unnecessary. I think this is what didnt help me enjoy it. I really want to give it a chance, but it has nothing to do with the lord of the rings, which is something that doesnt really bother me, but they should have made a totally new thing. The name seems just like an attention grab to bring you just some boring show that even it has this massive budget, it kind of feels cheap and fanfictiony.",roberto_costaplaya,4,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,1
Ununsed potential,"This show has a lot going for it. The visuals are gorgeous, beyond a doubt. The Trees, the elven architecture, the orcs, they look great. So far it really does look like Middle-Earth. The actors seem to take to their roles with sincerity, too. However, the cracks start to show early.There seems to be a hint of insecurity in the way that tension is built. Very early on, the show throws all the big evils of Middle-Earth at the viewer, without previous buildup to create suspense or tension. Within the episode itself, there are no real arcs that lead to me as a viewer getting hooked. The action scene also leaves a lot to be desired as, again, there is no true tension to the scene, no weight, no risks.The music seems to be somewhat hit or miss, often times also checking the box for being completely forgetable. There are good pieces of music within the episode too, music that would not be out of place in the movies.Again, the show has a lot going for it. There doesnt seem to be any major or unfixable problem, but they are pervasive across the spectrum. Here is to hoping that those will be ironed out before the season is over, because the potential is there and it would be a bloody shame if they dont capitalize on it.",kayvonrahimi,4,0.0,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,0,2
Slow start,"This was not exactly a gripping start. I have to admit the portrayal in the opening moments of the Eldar, the firstborn, the wisest, not as otherworldly beings but as violent brattish bullies was a shock and the development of the lead character from that very surprising. Im trying really hard to forget all I know of the story but the portrayal of Galadrial as embittered warrior without a husband is strange as I thought it was going to be true to Tolkien.The other characters were also a bit weird. They are given a strange set of accents which is also extremely different to the written work this production is based on and the script was dire. Im amazed you can throw such an amount of money at a thing and still have such repetitive and boring exposition read as if from a teleprompter.Im really looking forward to more Tolkien so I hope it picks up in the future once we are more familiar with the characters and the plot is more established.",RubyMouse,4,0.5333333333333333,No,A Shadow of the Past,8,15
Boring and tedious,"It is incredibly difficult to immerse oneself into this world.The dialogues, the characters, the plot...
Very little works with one another, making it impossible to take the episode as a whole seriously.Galadriel just happens to be saved from the sea (convenient)
She then just so happens to be saved from that raft by a bigger boat (convenient)
and on that raft she meets the exiled king of the Southlands (convenient).How are we supposed to take this all seriously?It really feel as if the plot just happens because the writers want it to.It robs the characters of any agency.Edit: and then we find out that the boats Captain who says he is obliged to take Galadriel to Numenor by law
is accused of treason for brigging an elf to Numenor.Umm... Which is it? Does he or does he not need to take her there?Again, the plots just happens because it needs to happen, regardless of the world around it.(sigh)Celebrimbor and Elrond basically teleport to Kazad Dum.Just the two of them, same clothes, no indication that they took a week-long journey to get there.They really look as if they walked from one green screen to the next.Again, it breaks immersion.The dwarves are great. Their city looks great.The actors sell it well enough. The dwarves are suspicious of Elrond, as they should be.Im immersed, yay!How Elrond finds his way into the city is a nonsensical waste of time, but the rest works.Queen Disa is one of the few likeable characters
(a bit weird for a dwarf to be so openly welcoming of foreigners given their general reputation but doesnt detract from her character)
Extra points for dwarves all being somewhat scottish.It fits the lore and the meta (yay, immersion!)Overall, not a good start to the series.Very little happens that manages to capture the attention
Really struggling to summon any enthusiasm to go see the next episode to be honest...",Rafario,4,1.0,Yes,Adrift,2,2
Unfortunately the show is just boring.,"You have Middle Earth and you dont know what to do with it. You have unbelievably high budget and you give me this CGI. Also the main character is just unlikeable and not because she is a woman but because she is so arrogant and she treats everyone with disrespect. And the harfoots are so out of place and forced in to the show just so you can have something that reminded us of the hobbits.People already figured out who is gone be Sauron.All the plot lines are just slow and boring i am sorry but that is the true.Heres something positive the orcs look cool and there are some very beautiful shots. But omg thats not enough for such a big and expensive series.If this show was not attached to the great fantasy world of Tolkin nobody would care about it.I guess you can buy everything with so much money: reviews, influencers, critics.

I really dont see where this is supposed to be connected to Tolkien and it reminds me more of Narnia, or at least something like that thats targetet towards children/younger audience.Lets see where this is going...",dsgodlike,4,0.5714285714285714,No,Adrift,8,14
Still need to improve,"This episode seemed more monotonous to me than the first. I think they missed the opportunity to create something that arouses the curiosity of those who are watching. I caught myself looking at my cell phone several times, because the dialogue scenes didnt hold my attention. In this second episode I realized that I dont like the cast either, the actors of Elrond and Galadriel dont bring me fidelity to what the actors of the 3 films brought. They sound very different from the movies and especially the books. The writers lacked research work to better understand the characters. As for the original characters, I felt the same emptiness in the dialogue and a failed attempt at trying to do something epic.",carlostbj,4,0.5,No,Adrift,5,10
Deeply disappointed,"I re-watched the hobbit and lord of the rings just before watching this series, and you know how I felt?Very excited.But then the series came out and starting from the first episode the plot was boring. It was too slow, completely parted from Norden Mythology, and at times ridiculous. The feud between elves and dwarves has gone from a serious life and death issue to a matter of not meeting a friend in 20 years. Really? I mean REALLY?At times the level of wokness could be ridiculous too, for example, two dark-skinned Harfoots had a very white kid.

Excruciatingly boring with bland characters. Couldnt wait for it to end,"Oh my... One day, this show will be taught in schools as an example of extremely bad writing. Characters are bland and uninteresting. Theres a character that literally explains his past and his current motivations to the audience. Ever heard of show, dont tell? I guess not.Galadriel jumped off the ship at the end of the last episode. One might wonder what her plan was. I mean, its not like she would just jump into the sea and just try to swim across the whole sea and reach the Middle-Earth? Right?

Stunning visuals but pretty borin,"There are stunning visuals and definitely thats a good thing. For sure it looks like very expensive episode, and series.My problem is that nothing is really happening here. I had to split watching this episode into 2 parts cause I accidentally went to sleep. Normally I dont sleep while watching so when it happens then it means that it has to be really boring.I am still confused with all the characters, few of them seems like they have a purpose but rest seems pointless. So whenever we jump from one character to other I just loose the tention and nearly forget what just happened.So far this series is not good or bad but they need to try harder to make it really entertaining.",boswojciech,4,0.375,No,Adrift,3,8
"Expensive scenery and makeup, cheap writing","Some might enjoy this, many enjoyed the Hobbit sequels also, though nowhere are neither close to the magic of the original 3 or the books by Tolkien. This is the same attempt at creating multiple episodes of rich, engaging content as they tried with the Mandalorian, but they fail with monologue that never go anywhere, they stretch and fill 80 percent of the episodes with back and forth in decision making and try real hard to give us somewhat of a cliffhanger in the final two minutes of each episode to keep us coming back but it falls short every time, the build up is nowhere near enough to keep it interesting. The most expensive television show made is, boring to watch.",Goagubbar16,5,0.375,No,Partings,3,8
Finally a bit of promise?,"This series frustrates. The initial four episodes were plain dull. Boring, even. All dialogue, zero action. I keep watching, thinking each episode will build to something greater, but then nothing. Episode 5 leads us to believe something may finally ensue in E6. Galadriel is meant to be one of the central character, and while there is some promise there I dont think theyve taken full advantage. This series feels aimless at times - wondering all over the place. I had very high hopes for this as I am a big LOTR fan. I thought this would be a great opportunity to build on that success. So far - and were halfway through - no dice. Highly disappointing.",mjsm60,5,0.45454545454545453,No,Partings,5,11
This show scream corporate writing,"There is slow burn and there is Rings of Power. We are well into the serie now and we are yet to see something happening other than setup. Episodes finishes with some epic orchestra and chorus while 3 ships sails away and nothing really happened. Every scene is met with a score that should underline a grand adventure and it just contrast so much with what we are seeing on screen. Yes it is gorgeous. Numenor, is splendid... But I fail to see the purpose of it.Galadriel continue to be insufferable impeteus brat. Every scenes she is in, it is her staring down, again with a dramatic score. They pulled a Marie sue even worse than Rey, because she constantly brag about it. And she is suppose to be the older one.She teaches Numenor soldier how to killed an Orc... Arent they suppose to be the best of the best? She take 5 of them at once without sweat ! Hey, corporates, women can struggle too, the can self-doubt, they can be desperate !We have yet to meet our antagonist, or did we? The plot is so well shrouded in mystery, that we loose focus of what or who we are suppose to care for...Give us meat!!.. all we got here is dry bones... gorgeous dry bones, but still dry as f@#$. I stopped caring and waiting for episode to come. I remembered sunday that an episode dropped 2 days before. LotR has become a non-event... how?This show scream corporate writing. Great ideas are killed in the eggs while we checked all the boxes to craft an uninspiring story.The only and surprising upside is Durin and Elrond. While nothing really happen there also, their scenes are funny and received better writing.With ep 6, we should have our first battle... but I fear it will be a fast skirmish and fleeing villagers.",kyrross,5,0.5294117647058824,No,Partings,9,17
High-budget content: episode 5,"Again, as Ive mentioned, the virtually static storytelling tempo continues. I guess its fine for a series, but were 3 episodes short of the seasons end, so once again, as Ive mentioned, this is going nowhere but to an intriguing cliffhanger.The entire season seems to be aimed at introducing the characters. Too bad that 90% of the characters are either dull or annoying. Since the story has many branches, not all of them have been sufficiently developed in this episode.In this episode, the writers keep introducing pointless conflicts and twists that dont add anything to the story but just make the characters constantly change their minds and feel inconsistent. Perhaps it would be easier to perceive even Galadriels stubbornness if she spoke and acted like an elf rather than an actor in an elf costume. But this is not the case since the dialogue is so unnatural and modernized.All in all, I went around in circles again, spending an hour watching the characters overcome made-up difficulties and constantly changing their minds. Already you can see that no characters are well-written, and most likely, there is no concrete vision of what they should become at the end since there is no clear understanding of the storys beginning and end.So it is quite understandable why history is stagnating because it simply has nowhere to go. We dont know what to expect from the characters as they always act differently and change their attitudes at the last moment. That is, we know who they are supposed to become in many years and their future merits, except that what is happening now has nothing to do with the established personalities in the universe.Thus, by episode 5 of the first season, the writers themselves have written out all the characters from the universe, making them more modern and completely different from expectations. If before, you would have thought that their way to the characters we know would be interesting, and we would understand why they became as we know them now so many years later. After this episode, given the pace and the approaching end of the season, I am fully convinced that the whole series is driven by completely different heroes, having nothing to do with the universe or Tolkien, who just put on fancy suits to do an amateur acting routine on expensive sets.The problem is that the creators dont want to tell me a story to interest me, to intrigue me. They want me to watch it. They want me to spend time watching content. All the effort is invested in the process, not the substance. Its a beautiful empty shell, but whats the point?",kuarinofu,5,0.7723577235772358,No,Partings,95,123
"Yet again, another average episode","Ep5 of Rings of Power is pretty much the exact same as the previous episodes. Average. For the most expensive TV show in history, it really does severely lack in writing and acting. This is the most boring episode so far, even though it does have some good moments;Elrond and Druin are the best characters, they have a great on screen friendship that reminds me a little of Legolas and Gimli, they have great banter and ever scene with them in it, is the highlight. Even though Galadriel is dull and boring, I enjoyed the little sparring scene where she actually showed a different emotion other than frown - joy and playfullness. It was a good scene. The scenes with the Harfoots was ok I guess, nothing special as with the scenes in the Tower.I know many people have compared this show with House of the Dragon, I cant help but do so to. We are also 5 episodes into that show, and yet we have fallen in love with the charcaters, and care about the story. Here, everything is just dull. There are no stakes, no tension, and no care for anyone the TV show wants us to care about. EP5: Partings is just the same old slow story with little happening. I dont think the show is bad, by any means, some of the bad reviews are a bit extreme. But I am keepiing my hopes up, that the show will improve, since Middle-earth is one of the greatest fictional places ever created.Cmon creators and writers, you can do better than this.",Dannyboi94,5,0.5357142857142857,No,Partings,30,56
Shallow beauty,"The visuals are spectacularly grand and the imagery delivers a fantasy world true to what one can imagine, Tolkien wouldve produced.But this is where shows shallowness already begins. The square-jawed, corporate haircut elves break the illusion as soon as they are in frame. All of the Harfoot scenes seem to come from a different series all together (a straight to dvd one). And as soon as some characters open their mouth (heres looking at you galadriel) youre distracted by their clumsy acting.Real shallow becomes the whole, once you look at the writing. Characters make decisions and possess knowledge just to move the plot, even if it makes no logical sence. They act so out of character sometimes that it irks you out of the illusion.How do the elves know the dwarves found mithril? How do they think it to be the answer to their problem whilst ignoring Galadriels warnings about Sauron?Why does wise Galadriel pledge Halbrands kingship to her cause behind his back even though he never shows any sign that he would be ok with that?Why do the Harfoots sing about not leaving anyone behind but want to take someones wheels in the very next episode?Why does Galadriel fabricate the story that her fellowship abandoned her cause because she was starting to look like the evil she was chasing, and not that they were tired of chasing a treath they thought wasnt real?It (and again, her acting) makes her seem like a lying, pouty child. Trying to get her way.All in their way do all these plotholes, irks and inconsistencies show that the beauty is only skin deep. And that The Rings of Power only looks good at first glance but falls apart rapidly once you look beyond.",thomasop,5,0.7216494845360825,Yes,Partings,140,194
Episode 5: Partings,"Before I begin this review, I want to give a friendly wave to the people who give 10/10 stars for these episodes and barely review anything else: I hope you get paid enough for this!As we are now 5 episodes in, barely any significant advances have been made in any of the storylines.Its interesting that the producers made everyone plain humans (the Elves, the Numenorians) in an attempt to make them more relatable, yet I dont care about any of them. It makes everything very bland.There is also a problem of scale to this show. We are being told, Galadriel is the commander of the northern armies, but all we got to see is 5 people who abandon her (and are gone to Valinor). Whole villages in the southlands are being abandoned but at the watchtower are only 50-100 people maybe. Numenor, the height of human civilization, has no army and only 5 ships to spare. Proclamations in the capital are heard by 200 people.Where is the scale? It all feels so small! It clashes with the huge CGI aerial shots.Even the costumes habe serious flaws. Under the armor you can see printed stretch undershirts that fold in places. What a joke.Galadriel/Numenor:The biggest flaw in this show (apart from the egregious lore inaccuracies and thinly veiled social justice placating to garner social media brownie points) is still Galadriel. This 5000 years old very noble elf , educated by the powerful Maia Melian. But in the show she is still his one-note Mary Sue character with vengeance on her mind, arrogant and entitled, not knowing how to behave in court in front of the descendants of Elronds brother. She lets herself be imprisoned by 2 guard and then overwhelms 4 guards when they try to put her on a boat. She wants Miriel to commit her forces to Galadriels task but gives no evidence of her case. The same with Halbrand. Apparently its just enough that Galadriel says he is royalty without confirming anything.The problem is that the writers think theyre doing female empowerment a service by showcasing this character. When she rides a horse in slow motion or fights inexperienced beta males or steps on a boat - the music swells like something awesome is happening - but nothing is, really. It makes you cringe. I dont care about THIS Galadriel because the writers havent give me a reason to. There is no depth to her character.And why does Galadriel have to train 5 peple for 5 minutes? All this scene does is placate Galadriel AGAIN and let her show off the males. Oh look, a strong badass woman! Wooooow! Because the numenorian soldiers-to-be dont really learn anything other than Galadriel is better than them.Is this really how they want us to see them getting ready for war? Where is the training arena? Do numenorian soldiers have to practise swordfighting in alleys between fish salesmen?Whats wrong with the mighty Numenor?They are the descendants of people who fought orcs and were rewarded with a long lifespan and an island of their own! This knowledge is not passed on? Where are their army and their drill instructors? Elendil - a petty lord - is the only guy who gives the recruits some tips?Why does Miriel have to ask for volunteers instead of just giving an order to her army?This is all so badly constructed!Hobbits:As with the last weeks, the Hobbit (yes they are Hobbits) story is still an empty void. The show is spinning its wheels for some inevitable cliffhanger that wants you to gape at. This week, we are getting a lovely rendition of a song by our female Frodo. A song worthy of a Disney movie for children.The tribe of Hobbits show their horrible lack of ethics again by attributing food shortage to the tall man that Nori keeps around. I dont like them.And I have to say, the CGI wolves look worse that the dog/pigs in the show ANDOR.Durin/Elrond storyline:As far as character scenes go, the most fun that I can find I find here. But the good feeling doesnt last long when I see them portraying Gil-Galad (the high king) as a moron.He knew about the tree (elvendom) rotting AND Galadriel suspected Sauron is back but didnt put 2 and 2 together??? Instead he sent her away because she might actually find Sauron?And what about that crap with the Silmaril being struck by lightning and going into the mountain to create Mithril? Thats not how this world works - its totally made up. And why mentioning a Silmaril anyway? Only fans know that and they are rolling their eyes when you change everything.Are you going to tell me that Gil-Galad knew for how many years that THE IMMORTALITY OF ELVES WOULD FADE if the dont get their hands on Mithril? And he didnt do anything? And how is Mithril then being distributed? As a suppository? As a lamp? A skin cream? Needless to say this is also not in Tolkiens stories. Its just an ore. Valuable, sure but even the Numenorians had it.Southlands:Why is Bronwyn (the only one who keeps herself clean with nice clothes) the leader of the villages now? Where are the actual leaders?Then they copycat themselves. Last episode, there was a scene in Numenor were volunteers put their arms up. The same thing here. Why? Dont know. I guess writing is pretty hard. And how will they fight? They have no weapons or food! They are cornered with their backs to the wall. Wouldnt it be better to flee somewhere else?Its all so unconvincing.Misandry:No immersion thanks to mundane elves, modern hairstyles and thinly veiled current political issues. Theres misandry galore here and girls (who got Middle Earth covered) are just hampered by incompetent or evil man folk.They try to be Game of Thrones by having scheming characters lleft and right but it just doesnt fit the world. Gil-Galad is unlikeable! Imagine that!And lest we forget - why are cows producing black thick stuff instead of milk because some orcs let slaves dig a trench they call a tunnel?I dont know what this show is supposed to be: its neither gritty nor witty enough to be in the same league as Game of Thrones.

The Singing was a mood killer,"The singing was a mood killer. 😂 I hope they dont do that again ever. Otherwise I may wander off a cliff. Seems very interesting that they included singing in it.... Did not hit the same as dwarves doing their song in The Hobbit, but maybe thats just me. Otherwise I find that a lot of the cinematography is really good and I enjoy that. Also the visual light vs dark is good too. Other than that though I am not sure that I am a huge huge fan..... but I also hate a lot of common day media Halo, most of marvel and Star Wars stuff is terrible and people just accept it because they think everything Is a 8,9 or 10 out of 10 lol.",mohrbencarson,5,0.4215686274509804,No,Partings,43,102
Tone is off...,"Incredible CGI, beautiful landscapes and lovely music. Thats about it.The tone is slightly off for a Tolkien adaptation in my opinion. The uber clean visuals, corny characters and acting at times and the lacklustre dialogue creates a pretty generic fantasy experience unfortunately, just will nicer CGI and music!Its a bit hard to diagnose exactly why but the above might be why the seriousness, grandeur and historic nature of the story seems to have been missed.Really its too early to tell but I suspect your average Tolkien fan will not be impressed moving forward. Especially considering much of the canon has been lost too. Generic fantasy lovers unite, you might enjoy this one!Ill continue to watch for the CGI realisation of known characters and places from the story I love. Its nice as a die hard fan to see these come to life. But my expectations for the story telling and feel are unfortunately lost.",PineLime,5,0.65625,No,Adrift,21,32
Lovely imagery...but more fan fiction,"While this is lovely, it is not The Silmarillion. If you have any knowledge of Middle Earth history, this show will drive you nuts. Too much deviation from the actual story. Much like Peter Jacksons Hobbit fiasco that took a great story and turned it into a fan fiction-like alternate story, this is not faithful to Tolkiens rather detailed work. That said, Ill still watch it because I am a Tolkien nerd who even endured the tedious Hobbit trilogy a few times just to see more of Middle Earth.A few side notes: I am constantly confused about when this is supposed to be happening. I can tell its supposed to be after the Noldor return to Middle Earth, and before the forging of the One Ring. So, somewhere in the middle? Obviously during the reign of Gil-galad. Hairstyles seem a little too modernistic at times. All in all, I suppose its better viewing than most shows Ive tried to watch recently.

Lackluster but hopeful,"Consider the amount of money and time put into this show you have to give it a chance. But lets be honest. The pilot was very underwhelming and honestly I was hesitant on episode 2. But episode 2 was much better. From dialog to acting and the general plot. The armor of the dwarves were fantastic and the world they live. The conversation with elrond was the first time you could relate and be more emerged.the bakround and environment was rich and looked really good. I mean considering the budget it was spot on.

This episode feels like an extension of the first episode.,"Progress is slow and the story is still thin. The political messages are delivered with the same intensity and the provokation is equal to the first episode. Galadriel is now established to be a real Mary Sue and loses credibility in the character, this is not Galadriel from Lord of the rings, this is a political message machine telling that this series is first and foremost for lbtq and neo feminists. I am not a Tolkien fanatic but it is clear to me that this series is not produced for followers of Tolkien. For my own part, the series is experienced as something I will still continue to watch. But just like last week, the acting is weak and the storyline is not sustainable. Some scenes are so ridiculous that you sit and get angry. But if you can swallow the thin story and the political messages, we can probably hang around until episode 3. It was fun to see a comeback from Lenny Henry, I didnt even think he was alive anymore. Our male Elf is uncomfortably similar to Don Lemmon on CNN, the connection is inevitable, hahaha. Well give it a chance to improve until next week.",n-karmhagen,5,0.5,No,Adrift,5,10
PG soap opera,"A Lack of visual storytelling and in its place, authentic costumes and sets. Lots of dialogue leading up to reveal something and cutting away from the scene just in time. Theres still no reason why the audience should care for these characters as of yet. Has the feel of a modern-show and not of a film. Cant help but be pessimistic about the pacing of it. Seems like were gonna have to wait till the last episode before our attention is satisfied. At no point do the characters actually seem in danger. Theres an air of arrogance surrounding this project. The quality of the visuals are really on point but the camera work is poor. The acting isnt bad for how poorly written the script is.",colinwhiggins,5,0.45454545454545453,No,Adrift,5,11
Its okay,"To begin with what I think is good, the dwarves were amazing. When Elrond enters Khazad-Dûm you really feel the size and splendor of the dwarf capital. They did a good job in portraying them and they at least for me lived up to my expectations. The rock-crushing contest was a bit weird and was by far the weakest part but Durin and Disa made up for that by having pretty good chemistry. The elevator ride where Elrond and Durin talk was also a really nice addition and really made you feel for the characters. The Arondir story line so far has been pretty entertaining as well, though the character feels a bit too stiff at times and their uniform looks silly.Now with the bad, with the exception of Arondir most of the elves are poorly developed and just plain boring to watch. Galadriel is this sword-wielding warrior who is always right and it just feels a bit unbelievable. I do not mind her being a warrior but please give her a weakness, make her feel like a character and not a caricature. The only thing you CAN say for her is that she is obsessed with hunting down Sauron but even that doesnt feel like a flaw.The harfoots are just plain boring, proto-hobbits that feel like theyre just there to be hobbits but not really, and provide some comic relief, though they fail at even this.",lilledokken,5,0.6666666666666666,Yes,Adrift,2,3

Mediocre at best,"So we have three storylines here.NÚMENOR: Here we have peek Amazons Galadriel being rash, abrasive, unbearable. An angsty teen girl who thinks she, and she alone is right and nobody knows/understands anything at all. She gets in Miriels face to a bit of a new pissing contest between both ladies. When Miriel doesnt give in to her unreasonable demands (give me an army so I can cleanse the Southlands) she then makes an even more unreasonable demand and requests to speak to Palantir, Númenors King. She gets jailed, for her insolence. There she meets with Halbrand, who actually seems like a grown up and tells her maybe she hit Miriels weak spot by naming her father. Then Pharazon shows up, with FOUR guards, to escort her to a ship that is going to take her to Middle Earth. Galadriel somehow manages to overpower and get all four of them inside her cell while she gets away. Once free, she manages to somehow break in the most guarded places in all Armenelos, Palantirs private chambers. She finds Miriel taking care of the extremely old king, waiting for Galadriel. Miriel shows our most despised elf her fathers Palantirl, which shows her the fall of Númenor (hence, this episodes title). Then the two gals bond and become bffs. Galadriel agree to be escorted to Middle Earth, with no army :( All the while, Isildur screws up his test in the royal navy, because theres this voice from the West that keeps on calling his name. He manages to get two of his mates expelled from the navy as well. And Elendils daughter flirts with Pharazons son. We then jump to Galadriel being escorted to her ship, but Nimloths leaves (Armenelos white tree) start to fall. This alarms Miriel, who summons a council session? And decides Númenor is going to send an army to Middle Earth in order to fight Sauron (?) in the Southlands.This plotline is as weak as it is relevant for the story. Its incredibly weak because its writing is unbelievably lazy. The whole point of Galadriel arriving at Númenor seems to be to act as a catalist for the Númenóreans to start a war in the Southlands. But this makes no sense in-universe. First, what makes up Miriels mind about it seems to be the fallen leaves of Nimloth, not so much Galadriels requests for help. That and the palantirls vision of Numenors fall. The same decision couldve been taken with those two elements alone, since the Númenóreans had a few cities established in Middle Earth by this point. They couldve noticed (as they did in the books) what was happening in the South, Galadriel, then, seems completely unnecesary. This is a test of how much better tought the original story was compared to Amazons. I guess showing a married, elf mother and Queen establishing her new kingdom in Lothlorien was too boring for Amazon. They needed to show us a strong independent woman, a warrior who only seems strong by making everyone else around her weak and stupid, urge an entire kingdom into war. Go figure, a quite underwhelming arc so far, narratively, of course. Númenor is visually stuning, as it should be since this is humanity at its peak. This is the main plotline in this show, Númenor wars againts Sauron in the Southlands are THE key events during the Second Age, that lead to Númenors fall.KHAZAD DUM: So far, this is the best plotline of the entire show and Elrond is, without doubt, the best written character. He has a depth which Galadriel lacks and is far more complex than his great-aunt. So, the dwarves have been helping elves in Eregion, building them great works for their smiths to forge in. However, Celebrimbor and Elrond suspect the dwarves are hiding something, so the latter goes to Khazad Dum in order to find out what is it. Both Durin and his wife lie to him, but he finds out anyways: the dwarves are starting to mine mithril. Here we glance at Elronds mind, his doubts about himself and his achievements when compared to his heroic father, Earendil, who was arguably the First Age greatest elf hero. He gives Durin some good advice concerning his own father, King Durin III. So far so good, Im liking this plot-line for the time being, mainly because of Elrond.SOUTHLANDS: This is also a weak plotline and it hast two fronts: Arondir and Bronwyn. So Arondir met Adar, the elf that seems to the the orcs leader. Adar tells him he will be let go, so that he can deliver the easterlings a message: go away, bend the knee or die. At the same time, Bronwyn seems to be the easterlings new leader and they went to some sort of southern Helms Deep, to defend against the orcs that invaded their villages. Thing is, food begins to scarce, and so the good easterling people begin to question Bronwins leadership. Her teenage son, of course, is the first to undermine his moms authority and takes a mate on a scavenging trip to their village, while theres still some light. The two arrive at the village and loot like a witcher on the path; that is, until conveniently some clouds cover the Sun and the orcs arrive at the party. Theos friend, quite rightly so, decides its time to leave while Theo gets greedy and goes for a last loot. Theo then faces the orcs, using the hilt he previously found. We learn thats what the orcs where looking for and that they are so dumb they never figure the kid was hiding all along in the well. Anyways, Theo flees with the incredibly well timed help of Arondir and his mum. The modern times family of three arrive safely to south/eastern Helms Deep. Theo finds out his hilt is a gift Morgoth gave some human leader eons ago in exchange for his loyalty and that therere some Sauron loyalists among his people.This plotline is an interesting idea, but its execution is, again, lazy. Arondirs arrival is too well timed, as is the morning rise that, ultimately, saved them from the orcs. Everything seems too forced and convenient to be believable, and there isnt much that explains why people follow Bronwin or why Theos special. Nevertheless, Im still giving it the benefit of the doubt since the easterlings fall is an interesting storyline and unexplored by Tolkien.A mediocre episode, at best. Númenors plot is still very weak; Amazons Galadriel continues to be unsufferable and unelvish. We got a deeper glance at Pharazon, which was kind of okay-ish, but that was all. Elrond, as Ive said, is the best part of this show, the only elf that seems and feels elvish. And the southlands are meh. No hardfoots though, fortunately. Also, there isnt a coherent timeline and I cant place the show yet in the Second Age. For instance, the Rings havent been created yet, since we are watching Eregions first steps into forging, and Sauron hasnt yet established in Mordor, which places the show around 1000ish Second Age. But Númenors plotline and characters (Its morally decadent greatness, Tar-Palantir, Tar-Miriel, Pharazon, Elendil and Isildur) all are placed at 3100ish SA. I just cant think of any reason to mess up the timeline this bad. Unless we are seeing, literally, two separate timelines with a split noone has figured, I just dont get it. I guess Ill keep on watching, for Elrond, Halbrand and Elendil. Maybe Pharazon.",oloccorj,5,0.2857142857142857,Yes,The Great Wave,2,7
Somewhat better,"There is some actual story growth in this episode (much thanks to the dwarves and that storyline) Im trying not to let the time compression bother me, but it is. The rings were already forged by the time of Numenors
destruction and it is Elendil who leads the peoples to middle earth and not for some rescue of the south lands. Also when the do go before to fight Sauron its the counsin of the queen that leads them and is a great military leader but heres hes a wimpy politician who can barely hold a sword. THIS is who is going to lead Numinor? There are a few other issues with the lore but not like the show actually cares about that.Galadriel - still as annoying, ridiculous, actress just does not do it.Too many sub plots (why the heck does Elendil get a daughter and why should we care about her and her love life when they cant even give Galadriel her family?)Love story aint working. So awkward, as awkward as that over shoulder sword hold.All that to say this is by far the best episode released yet.",doulakarenback,5,0.375,No,The Great Wave,3,8
Episode 4 Great Wave,"Its interesting that most people who praise the show keep mentioning how epic the show looks, how fantastic the costumes are or how nice the sets come across. Almost nobody praises the characters, the intricate dynamics between them or dialoge that feels intelligent.And theres a reason for it.At least we get a respite from the uniteresting Hobbit storyline. This alone warrants a higher rating.But other things drag the episode down again. For instance the hamfisted attempt at allegory by having some 100 background actors being afraif of losing their jobs beause one ONE elf landing on their shores by accident. The first thing I think is not wow thats clever but why are the Numenorians written so stupidly?Ar-Pharazon proclaims: My friends, trust in me, for by the calluses on my hands, I swear that Elven hands will never take Numenors helm.And nobody remembers that Elros Tar-Minyatur who was their first king actually WAS an elf?And how does he have calluses? He is a politician!Wow, thats really some Star Trek Picard level of writing.So far, so stupid. I dont know anymore if this is all just fan-baiting to generate buzz or just incompetence. I guess neither is commendable.Galadriel gets pissed off when she doesnt get what she wants, yet she is a 5000 yeart old elf born in the Undying Lands in one of the most noble houses. What will she learn in half a lifespan of a hobbit what she didnt learn in 5000 years?Yes, she HAS A TEMPEST in her but lets herself be imprisoned by 2 guards and later deals with 4 guards easily to get out. One just has to marvel about the writing staff.And why is Galadriel so small? And how does Miriel expect Galadriel coming through the window of the tower she just climbed up?Adar is an okay character so far. By giving him long hair, he immediately looks more like an elf and not like a human after a visit to a salon (Elrond/Celebrimbor/Arondir).And also the parts with Durin and Elrond were okay. His (for some reason) african dwarf wife seems out of place in a medieval underground society, but when she is not anti mansplaining, I can tolerate her.The timeline is totally messed up by this point. Three days have gone by in Numenor but in Eregion, theres a third of a large tower being build in the same time. It looks more like this has taken a couple of months. Arondir is maybe a couple of days in captivity but whole villages of the Southlands are evacuated already. It doesnt fit.Isildurs motivation doesnt make sense here. He hears voices from the west of the island calling to him and thats why he deliberately fails to join the army. Now he wants to join to sail away to Middle Earth? What about those angelic voices? Hello writers, do you compare notes?The idea of the rising sun saving the good guys from the orcs was good but why didnt at least some of the orcs kept pursuing? Just last episode there were orc archers cleary seen guarding the trench in broad daylight. And suddenly, no more arrows fly. Very weird direction.Overall a better episode but so many stupid things. The writing is not on point and not on par with other high-calibre shows. If this didnt have the budget and the brand name, nobody would care. Its too slow and a bit boring. The dialoge and the caracters are meh and some are just cringeworthy.Minor things:<ul><li>why dont the villagers go back during the day to get their food?</li></ul><ul><li>Elrond was never a dwarf friend</li><li>Celebrimbor still very off and comes off more like a grandmother with a secret.

Schadenfreude,"Dear Miriel,Thank you for putting Galadriel in her place.Kind regards,
Real Tolkien fans.At least this episode didnt have the Harfoots. The Adar angle was interesting, and Theos avoiding the orcs was genuinely hair raising (not so keen on Orcs speaking in English when not conversing with humans or elves though, surely they have their own language?). Bronwyn being in her position I do not believe at all, but I guess those humans are all aimless so whatever. And Galadriel was doing Galadriel things again. At least she finally showed some humility in Miriels fathers chambers. Khazad-dum looked good again too (especially the new metal angle), though Elrond is a bit odd.Numenor looked good as always, though Miriel going with Galadriel and the ship is a recipe for Pharazon to take over, and should begin the decadence that leads to Numenor getting destroyed (finally got something right Amazon).Overall, best episode so far but that isnt saying much.

Better than episode 1,"I thought this episode picked up a little despite the odd plot lines that make only occasional sense. I liked seeing Khazad Dum in all its glory - though the whole axe contest felt pointless. The Galadrial swimming across the ocean blue - WHAT? - was somewhat mad but introduced Halbrand who intrigues. As does the stranger and the Harfoots. While I thought it was better than episode one, the links between the different stories are not explored. There is no coherent overall story being told which, after 2 hours, youd expect. There are too many characters I am not even slightly invested in, and I am starting to find Galadrials petulant behaviour very irritating.Visually some good but sterile moments.

I chose the latter. Unfortunately this also kills the soundtrack which dramatically decreases the viewing enjoyment and Ill not be going back for the rest of the series which is a little bit sad, but Ill cope.I wonder what would happen if they had decided the simple folk should have a Patois accent and cast white actors who couldnt do it justice, or worse still who could.It did look pretty though.",chippysmyth,5,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,1

The cast diversity doesnt matter at all, I just think they got a few wrong choices there, mostly the elves. Might be the bias and comparison from LOTR coming in here.

It honestly appears that they might have read the back cover and then made up their own story to fill in the rest. There is no loyalty to the lore. They ignore the material Tolkien gifted to them and instead filled their pages with muck and drivel.If you are expecting a Tolkien series, skip this.

Shadows of Tolkien,"For all its lush landscapes and effect shots, the first episode was kind of unengaging.The elves lost their ethereal nature and become humans with pointy ears and super powers. There are some very modern looking hair styles here: Elrond looks like coming right out of a salon and Arondir sports a buzz cut with skin fade.Elrond is a political speech writer who writes for the High King Gil-Galad. You feel the Tolkien yet?The societies are so diverse this show may also happening on Times Square, which takes me out of Middle Earth to be quite frank. Please be more diverse but stick with the world the author built.Based on all the promo stuff they released I was ready to hate this series but now I can just say: meh.Walking on well-trodden paths, the Hobbit parts of the story felt unnecessary and copied from The Lord of the Rings. You have your Sam and your Frodo and people advise them not to stray too far.The swooning between Arondir and Bronwyn already gets on my nerves and Galadriel is a one-note unlikable vengeance-driven warrior super hero, let down by stupid men. We get told she is a commander but lacks any leadership qualities. Odd.So far we we get three story threads with headstrong independent females. And in regards to that I am already apprehensive about the upcoming Numenor story.Galadriel getting sent to Valinor ist just preposterous. She went into exile to Middle Earth to rule lands of her own and support Sindarin Elves in the wars to come. A far more interesting tale.And the dialogue is quite boring and strange at times. The difference between a rock and a ship is that the rock thinks about the darkness below and thats why it doesnt float? What? Then Finrod (not mentioned by name) says to young Galadriel that he wont always be around! The thing is, as an immortal Elf living in Aman before all the bad things happened - its very strange for him to predict his death.The Flight of the Noldor (not mentioned by name) is also very briefly mentioned and lacked all the depth it deserved.The we get to see a map of Middle Earth. But at that time the map looked completely different! There were many more lands left of the map in the region called Beleriand and it got destroyed when the gods fought a brutal war against Morgoth. But who cares about that, right?The brief cgi vistas are beautiful though and looked fantastic. The ceremonial armor of the elves looked very unpractical (they cant turn their heads) and the wooden armor of the Sindar elves looked like they dont belong. Im not a fan of grandpa Celebrimbor but more on that in the next reviews if I dont just stop watching.Kind of a let-down.

Not as bad as expected!,"I had very low expectations for this series, I was pleasantly surprised. However, the story doesnt feel really supportive. The story feels like it could have been written by a teenager and feels childish and thin in several places. Although there are less political messages than expected, it is enough to make you feel sick in slightly different parts of the film. The actors havent really impressed after the first episode and they leave room for wishing more. Visually, the film is really impressive. Looking forward to the next episodes impressions. I would have given the rating higher if Galadriel had been more believable and if I had avoided all the political messages. If Hollywood wants higher ratings for their films, they have to raise the employment requirements for those who work with the story.",n-karmhagen,5,0.6,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,5
Could have been better,"I truly wanted to love the first episode, but I just cant get behind the poor writing. The elves dont feel like elves. They are just pretty humans with pointy ears. They can be petty, snarky, clumsy and silly. To make up for their baffling lack of grace, the other races of Middle Earth are literally covered in dirt.The episode opens with a nonsensical metaphor about stones looking down and boats looking up, and the writing doesnt improve after that. Ill avoid any spoilers, but an unreasonable conflict between Galadriel, who is pursuing a vendetta against Sauron, and the leadership of the High Elves is almost concluded within this episode. I call it unreasonable because the other sides motives or reasoning arent explained at all - painting them as utterly inept.The acting was good, but because some of the elves are so graceless they make the rest of the elf characters seem flat (Arondir in particular). Galadriels over the top fight scene also lacked any element of danger, making the experience lackluster. The Harfoots are adorable, but they have an infuriating Irish accent.Where the episode shines is the music and the settings. Both do a wonderful job of distinguishing the different locations, and the transition between them was seamless.",kasandriamillo-41840,5,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,5,10
Seems to be for Children,"I fast-forwarded a lot of the endless talking and romance scenes. The pace is incredibly slow. You get to know every character and their favorite memories, regrets, fears, concerns. I am not that interested.A lot of kids are in this TV series, and I get the feeling this is supposed to be Lord of the Rings for kids. Of course there has to be one kid with the evil talisman that has a connection to the Orcs and Sauron. This has been done so many times before.This episode was not that great, and it was really predictable. It was fun to watch the primitive version of the hobbits, and some of the old characters from the movies.",Johnny_West,5,0.6666666666666666,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,6
Prime Videos What If series,"The first episode looks good, visually there were things that looked good. The decorations of the Trees with the carving for example. Lindon looked well as far as we could see. The Silvan Armor looks interesting. Felt like I was watching something new, other times felt like I was watching the Witcher.If we take the Tolkien out of this episode, the episode could have been better; Because on its own its an ok watch. There isnt a lot going on and the story is starting..They said this was Tolkien, but why doesnt it feel like it? Its Tolkien minus the lore, minus the original characters, minus the history. In other words its a What if Series based on Tolkien.This is not it.",luisgus-72268,5,0.6,No,A Shadow of the Past,6,10
Im not really sure what I make of it,"Theres a lot of totally positive or negative reviews, I went into this not expecting much due to the ramblings of the usual content creators I watch but It was better than I expected.Id say give it a try.That being said Im left not sure whether I like it or not, after episode one I can say it looks nice, the sound design is good, the music a little mixed, acting - Id say they are doing the best they can.Thats the problem though, the story so far is a mess of a lot of new characters many of whom dont portray much emotion. I dont actually like any of them.I feel as if the actors are doing the best they can with a weak directionless script. Lets see if it improves at the season progresses.",phil-592,5,0.6666666666666666,No,A Shadow of the Past,6,9
Bump,"Hopefully this was just a onetime bump in the first season but it was not pleasant. I think every episode in a show should aim to be good, but I do understand that sometimes there is need to slow things down and give backstories and explanations and here they failed. The dialog had no flow and the way they jumped between Harefoots, Eldron &amp; Durin, Orchs and humans made the whole episode feel empty and uneven.Last episode was a 9 for me which I seldom give and season one was balancing between a weak 8 and strong 7 before this episode and now its a 7. Im hoping for a strong finale and actually think that will happen. The environments and shooting in this show is truly great.",hannes-gudjonsson,5,0.07692307692307693,No,The Eye,1,13
A big letdown after last weeks visually spectacular episode,"After the breathtaking spectacle that was episode 6 I was really expecting Rings of Power to keep that momentum going. Alas it does not. This week we are back to the harfoots and theyre just so boring. Theres no other word for them. Between the terrible accents and the fact that they are completely devoid of any charm whatsoever (they talk about how they stick together and look out for one another while leaving the slow, sick and injured behind to die). Their meandering plot just feels pointless in the grand scheme of things. Galadriel spends much of the episode in the company of Theo, Im hoping their dull interactions will actually lead to something interesting down the road. Theo, Galadriel assures us, has the makings of a great soldier and is gifted Galadriels sword. So far he just irritates me anytime he comes onscreen. Heres hoping hell become more interesting down the road. Galadriel reveals that her husband Celeborn has seemingly died in battle, fans of Tolkien know this is not true so itll be interesting to see if Rings of Power will deviate from this. Also the whole oh no Isildur is dead, every fan of The Lord of the Rings, who I imagine are in the majority watching this show, knows he survives so again it seems pointless. I think theyre going for the whole his horse will find him half dead and hell ride back on the horse. Just like Aragorn when he fell off the cliff in The Two Towers. I think the show goes out of its way to give nods to Peter Jacksons trilogy. Galadriel and Theo hiding from the orcs felt very reminiscent of the hobbies hiding from the ringwraith in The Fellowship of the Ring. Overall this episode was way too slow for me. Elrond and Durin were among my favourite characters so far but they were so sappy and boring here. Bronwyn and Arondir dont get the attention they deserved in this episode. My final critique, how was Halbrand able to ride a horse with an injury so serious only the elves could heal it? Lets hope we get a stellar finale to make up for this disappointing episode.",oliviasaich,5,0.4,Yes,The Eye,6,15
Poor direction,"Despite the fact that I liked the series in general, I think its biggest problem is that it has entire episodes with scenes that are either very long, some seem unnecessary or uncomfortable. As in this case, it happened specifically with the part where galadriel approaches to speak with Miriel and Elendil, which ends with the latter crying.This scene seemed cheap to me. It would have been better to have elendil agree with the queen, then escort her to her tent and leave her, and then in a moment alone collapse in tears. Having him there crying with his back to the queen and galadriel felt quite akward to watch. I think they need to find a better director for the episodes ahead.And lets not talk about the Balrog revelation. It would have been better to just shaw a paw stepping on the leaf instead of the entire dude, letting us no surprise for later. As I said, cheap narrative, cheap direction.",luiscalleparra,5,0.55,Yes,The Eye,11,20
What a bunch of filler,This episode felt unnecessary. So much of it couldve been left out. Theres so much unnecessary written in drama and bad acting. Like why do they all get split up when the volcano ash comes down? That doesnt make any sense. Theres so many of them and they just happen to pop up every now and then. Like you dont see Halbrand till the final 5 minutes. Also what happened to Isildur... he just disappears from the episode and no one tries to find him. Then you see Adar and the orcs are walking about where Isildur wouldve been.Nori and the wizard still continues to be boring and were 1 episode from the finale... theres like no character development in any of them. The wizard has awful writing thus far. He shows glimpses of magic now and again and then wonders off.Some of the chanting dialogue just feels so forced. Are we meant to feel sorry for the queen of Numenor who just became blind?,joelferguson98,5,0.7391304347826086,Yes,The Eye,51,69
I expected more,"I was really looking forward to this series, the photography and the beauty of the sets are incredible, and the animators are to be congratulated. But what was wrong for me was the direction. Galadriel is a far cry from what he always was in the books. They created a new character and named her. For a main character, she is uncharismatic. If she died, I dont think anyone would miss it. Elves dont look like elves, and the plot of this first episode made me sleepy. The dialogues are below expectations for a work by Tolkien, and the impression I have is that it was written by people who have never read his work.",carlostbj,5,0.4444444444444444,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,9
Average first episode,"As a massive fan of the original LotR trilogy and even the Hobbit trilogy, I was super excited for this series when it was announced. My faith in it has declined over the months with all the news about it, but I decided to watch it with an open mind.A Shadow of the Past is a very average first episode to the series. It isnt bad, but isnt great either. The visuals, production and music are amazing, as you would expect from the most expensive TV show in history. But that being said, the characters are all bland, with the exception of Nori Brandyfoot. Shes the only character I could believe actually fitted the Middle-Earth world, everyone else just looks miscast. The Elves all have modern hairstyles - its strange seeing one of them with a crop cut or a skin fade.The dialogue is also horrid and cringe at times, and the actors deliver these lines like they are reading off a card off-screen.It isnt all bad, the episode was enjoyable. Like I said, visually, its insane. The quality of the sets and with the locations they filmed, it certainly feels like Middle-Earth. Thankful the next episode was better, but so far, its a little underwhelming.5/10.",Dannyboi94,5,0.6163522012578616,No,A Shadow of the Past,196,318
"Great cinematography, predictable writing , bland and boring","The great tragedy of this show, is the sheer potential with this kind of budget and actors. The finale is no different, you can see what could have been, but they fail to deliver.The writing quality is poor as ever, with twists and turns predicted by countless people. However, the cinematography remains excellent, acting of certain characters are still excellent, such as Daniel Weyman and Robert Aramayo, whos take on the characters feels consistent.The pacing is poor and the forced connection between some characters that I will not name for the sake of avoiding spoilers is very obvious and frankly amusing. It has bits and pieces that are fun though, specially scenes around the Stranger, even though we all now know who he is.Overall not the worst episode in the season, but a weak finale with many questionable decisions plagued with inconsistent writing. Rings of Power will remain one of the great What Ifs of the modern era.",abirzenith,5,0.6049382716049383,No,Alloyed,49,81
"Better, but nothing was great","I didnt even realize until after Its finished this episode that this was the season finale. Because nothing felt really epic or having built up to a great moment. Not much action, no big battle or conflict. Lots more talking and characters staring concerned into the camera - Galadriel staring at Elrond and he staring back, Nori staring at her family, the Stranger staring at everyone, the camera lingering on the mithrial and forge; just too much with the long lingering shots. The only good part of the episode was with the Stranger, and that was ok at best.The big reveal wasnt believable nor did it make a ton of sense. Too many lucky happenstances had to have happened to bring it about. The director probably thought the ending shots were epic but they were boring, predictable, and took too long.And my whole family all laughed out loud at the song in the closing credits. Whatever stoic feeling there may have been was quickly dashed the moment that song started. Hopefully the writers and directors take note of what needs to be fixed and make Season 2 a whole lot better. As had been said before, I feel like all that happened this whole season couldve been covered in a 4-minute prologue.",RustyBoyz,5,0.5306122448979592,No,Alloyed,52,98
The show should have focused on Arondir,"Arondir is a way better character than Galadriel. Shes too wooden and her story is quite boring. The hobbits - sorry, harfoots - arent much better. Their interactions with the meteor man feel much too cliche. It reminds me of the hobbit movies (and, if youve seen those movies, you know thats not intended as a compliment). The actor for Elrond is ok. I dont like his story with the dwarves though. It feels weird, like Im watching Star Trek instead of Lord of the Rings. And I do not care for the dwarves. Gimli worked because he was the single dwarf among elves and men. As we have seen from the hobbit (to reference those films again) the more dwarves you have, the worse your experience as a viewer is going to be. So yes, I like Arondir but they should have left out his love story. Why? Because weve seen the elf/human love story already in Peter Jacksons films, and it was done much better in those there. It seems like an attempt to recapture that magic. Just focus on Arondir and his adventure and add some stakes. The show feels too safe right now.",Please_pick_a_different_username,5,0.42857142857142855,No,Adar,12,28
Interesting plotline completely wasted - SPOILERS for EP 3-6,"Well I did not want to lengthen the main series review but here goes:This show did a lot of things wrong, but did a couple of things right. Arondir and Adar. Unfortunately Arondir will step aside the moment Galadriel shows up, and becomes a background random elf soldier. I suspect now that Sauron is back in Mordor Adar will do the same and conveniently disappear from the story with a quick arc. I just wanted to write this review to mourn these potentially interesting characters whose arcs got nowhere. Arondir was placed in this interesting spot where he loved a human in a village were elf soldiers and humans did not like each other and tensions ran high.So what came of this intriguing setting you ask? The answer is NOPE, NOPE, NOPE and NOPE
The village tensions disappear because they abandon their village cause orcs and stuff. They fought the orcs and stuff. The prejudiced elves, you thought something would happen there? NOPE, they all disappeared (We see Arondir get captured, and although it was cheesy, it was plausible. How did the elven garrison get captured entirely? They were in a fortress and were armed fully but dont worry it happened off screen.) He gets to shine with some fight scenes but they were very cheesy. Apparently the orcs leave weapons on the ground in slave pits, just in case they feel like a rebellion. So after all that build-up of him being a prisoner, fighting back, losing friends he should have the agency to free himself, you know as the main hero in this plot arc? NOPE, the leader casually releases him to send a message to the poor villagers hiding from the orcs.Why is this force who captured several previous villages, and the elven batallion secretly without anyone even noticing, does not do the same for those villagers? I dont know, I guess so we can have a battle scene...
O. K. lets accept that these villagers will pull a seven samurai here maybe after this battle, we will return to the villagers, tensions, maybe we will get to work on Arondirs complex relationship with this lady, and maybe we will see more of Adar. Maybe... just maybe this show will continue one of the plots they started properly ??NOPE, sorry B-plot we had enough filler now move aside so Numenorans and Galadriel can take over! Ohh and the battle you were fighting so hard for all these episodes, did we win? NOPE, the bad guys stashed the McGuffin in the other bag, you all die now!",ulasyu,5,1.0,Yes,Adar,1,1
What a mess!,"None of the storylines offer anything new or exciting - all though Im slightly intrigued by the Galadriel storyline. The character build up is completely lacking - again, only Galadriel seems to have some flesh to her character. The surprises are seen a mile away - seriously, the build up to a character surprise is made up by an 1980s bar brawl to show how the character kicks ass (in a rather brutal way). Oh, and dont get me started on the hobbits!I have been impressed by the settings and overall production value so far, but this episode has the worst CGI creature yet - you know it when you see it.This is one sore missfire.",gabriel-80,5,0.0,No,Adar,0,1

I really hope it gets better, because I really want to like this. I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy and was hoping this would be fun to watch like that was.

Expensively poor.,"An episode full of revelations that most already knew. There is action, there is progress in the plot and visual quality. It is part of what I look for when it comes to enjoying content, and as such I give it 5 points. From a plot point of view, it falters everywhere. Its amazing that when I think about it theres no particular story arc that Im interested in seeing. I mean, there are jumps here and there in each plot line, but I could rather say which one catches my attention the least. Thats one of the worst signs for me. I dont feel attached to most of the main characters, and neither do they themselves since they change their attitude every half chapter.Frankly, the most expensively poor product in a long time.",abysz-23020,5,0.5102040816326531,No,Alloyed,50,98
More Plot Armour than OG LOTR,"Nah bro these halffoots half way to much plot amour, the way they were fighting the three chicks was so badly written. And saurons reveal was in my opinion handled poorly aswell. To me it was clear that it had to be either the so called Stranger or Halbrand, though I always tended more to believing halbrand would turn out to be sauron. Also for it being the last episode of the first season their wasnt a real ending to nor a cliffhanger that left me on the edge of my seat, it was just predictable and mainly boring like most of the series. Though I do liked how they showed the Produchtion of the three elven rings. Overall I would say Episode 8 is a great representation of the series, with too much screentime for seemingly irrelevant characters, predictable outcomes and a fakely created tention that, at least for me, did not get me at all.Major L in my opinion, please leave it at this or majorly change things in season 2.",jonahwach,5,0.6190476190476191,Yes,Alloyed,13,21
Rings of Power Nap,"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is the greatest television show ever produced... At putting the audience to sleep.The writing is terrible; the acting, bland. We barely know anything about several of the main characters before everything is neatly resolved.Unfortunately, I just cant recommend this show unless you need help getting a good nights rest. The true power of Sauron is to make people pass out and dream, which is a good thing. In todays day and age, you need several hours of REM sleep to repair all of your neurons. With the boring dialogue and absolutely no emotional investment whatsoever, you can drift off to sleep peacefully knowing that whatever happens, Frodo WILL destroy the one ring in a few thousand years. So rest easy, Rings of Power viewer!I strongly recommend this show for nursing homes, insomniacs, and those with active minds that just cant seem to fall asleep on your own...

"Not a great start, but lets see.","First of all, some of the scenery and the CGI were absolutely stunning,but some of the costumes felt out of place and didnt look really good.The music didnt really stand out in my opinion.Now for the rest, this is just my opinion(and a minor spoiler warning).You would kinda hope that Galadriels company of immortal warriors, who are the longest serving company(i think) would be skillfull and smart soldiers, well nope.You would think Galadriel would be a good commander? She force-marches a company of maybe 10 persons into the mountains,past the point of fatigue and support. TO FIND SAURON. THE ULTIMATE EVIL.Personally i didnt like the potrayal of Elrond as a lower rank politician and the dialogue between him and galadriel was kinda cringeworthy.The scenes with the haarfoots were just boring and felt forced.Giving it a 5 star rating cause i dont want to be absolute and wanna see where its going, but the first episode was below expectations. For me at least.",dsgodlike,5,0.6862745098039216,No,A Shadow of the Past,35,51
It just lacks impact.,"Its not terrible. Some interesting things happen. But they are never followed up or seem to have any real meaning. Fight scenes arent horrible but again seem to lack something and feel hollow. Plus I feel like I can actually see the wires attached to actors hanging from the ceiling sometimes the way they defy physics and fly trough the air. Which is just weird because again the scenes are not terrible and with some grounding, some real direction, they could be fantastic.Another real sore spot for me is I dont remember any character specifically, or even really care about any of them for that matter. Again, the actors arent necessarily terrible, just not great either. I dont feel the reverence of these supposedly epic moments. Sometimes they seem to not really understand what emotion they want to convey to the audience, so that have these in-between looks on their faces. Which kills the moments.Just like the first 2 episodes, the CGI is pretty good overall and some scenes I will give the credit they deserve for being gorgeous. Also some of the set pieces, armor, artwork, things of that nature are pretty good. But there is also a negative here as well because the thing that usually brings it all together for me is the music or the score. It might as well not be there. This shows music falls completely flat. It is just not good. There was even one scene I remember where I thought they made a mistake and it was the wrong track. It just did not work for the scene.Amazon could be doing better. This show could be much more. This episode is an honest 5 because there are redeeming qualities but not much else.",bacher-98620,5,0.5,No,Adar,11,22
Dont judge a book by its cover,It looks phenomenal. Its clear why the show cost so much. While it is beautiful it is not always convincing. It sometimes looks surreal and you can tell that its not real and there are a lot of visual effects. I think its because of the sometimes poor lighting. The sets made for the harfoots are practical and look great. While not every visual effect looks perfect it is close to perfect. There are also a lot of beautiful landscapes and practical sets which look amazing.Looks are not everything. The story is neither captivating nor innovative.

"Silly characters and plot, enjoyable fight scene","The battles were good. However my enjoyment of the episode is reduced because of choices with regards to the plot and the characters.As many others have iterated before me, I just cannot agree with this version of Galadriel - not the wise and revered sorceress, but an unsympathetic entitled angry warrior.With regards to the plot, it is difficult not to be annoyed by the fact that everybody seems to move in directions to accidentally appear where they are needed at just the right time. And that main characters deal carelessly with potentially powerful weapons.

A huge improvement over the first 4 episodes.,"Id like to start by saying that I split the score of this episode in two, one for each half of the episode, and went with the average for the IMDB rating (actually I had to round down). I also would like to say that I never cheered so hard for the orcs, but the plot armor in this episode shone stronger than Galadriels Elven Plastic Mail.The first half of the episode is a boring mixture of bad choreographies and inexplicable military decisions. Its a 4 at best. On the second half we have some nice character progression and good pace. Id say its a solid 7. The main problem is that no matter how good the fan fiction is, its still fan fiction, and still strays form the authors words/intentions.Overall the series is getting better, but still reminds me too much of some CW production, or maybe a slightly improved Shannara Chronicles.",rireisfp,5,0.39285714285714285,No,Udûn,22,56

And how did not Galadriel, Halbrand or Adorin recognise the shape of a hammer? The episode should have ended with some of them noticing it. Preferably Garadriel and then we get the scene with the opening of the water and the volcano.There is a common thing in this show that some of the scenes are just so bad that the bring the hole show down with them. Other things can be great and I feel that this episode is the perfect example of this. I give it a 5/10. Could have been a 8/10..",nwnctphgz,5,0.6666666666666666,Yes,Udûn,2,3
An okay beginning to a show I dreaded watching.,"Ignoring the inaccuracies to the source material (flying dragons (first dragons didnt fly and couldnt breath fire and when they showed up it was in a last ditch effort by Morgoth to save himself), Finrod surviving the second age (though Sauron was partially responible for his death as told in the tale of Beren and Luthien), Celeborn and Celebrian not showing up despite Celeborn marrying Galadriel in the 1st era while Celebrian was born in the year 300 second era, and the whole putting 2 stories that originally took place 2000 years from each other, Saying that all 2 relations between men and elves ended in tragedy despite the fact Idril &amp; Tuor eventually sailed to the undying lands and Tuor being counted among the eldar). This episode does a fine enough job to start the show. It sets up most of the major storylines but doesnt automatically reveal all its cards but it didnt really blow me away.The acting was mostly good (especially from Robert Aramayo who plays Elrond), the cinematography and editing was mostly competent. Music felt a bit generic but I might need to rewatch it a couple times to form a better opinion on it, and the effects where mostly also fine (with the notable of a few scenes at the beginning).The dialogue was a bit hit or miss. Tolkiens work mostly prides himself on his rich use of language and its something most adaptations can have problems with (looking at you Hobbit trilogy). Since this serie has to invent most of the dialogue itself it could go horribly wrong if they used too much modern talk, overexplanation or too simplistic. And there were some lines that certainly had this issue (mostly the scenes with Medhros) but for the most part it was fine and sometimes even good.Overall I would say that despite being a terrible adaptation of the source material, it does fullfill its job as simple entertainment that most people can watch without too much difficulty. Shame for me but if they made the show how I wanted it, it would be unmarketable which it not something Jeff wants.Hard to say what this means for the rest of the series since it can get better, worse or stay the same quality, but Ill keep watching and if it ever becomes terrible ill stop watching. After all its just a show, the books still exist and there are so many other things i can watch or do with my live.",leonhardwalhout,5,0.2,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,5
Disappointing and average,"Its okay. Wasnt really all that good but an okay thing to watch if a bit boring at times. Its what you would expect from some no-name show, that you could watch to waste some time away.But for a Lord of the Rings series its just disappointing and lacking that certain spark, that mood, that special feeling that even the worst lotr movies got right. And while the visuals where good that feeling isnt just something you can create by throwing money one it... Simply put, its lacking. But even that could mostly have been forgiven if it was really lord of the rings. Can you really call it that when it only has the most general of things in common. You should not judge a book by its cover but in this case its only the covers that they got in common.",loptr-24929,5,0.25,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
"Cold, sterile and boring","Remember when Lord of the Rings used to be good? Remember when the story it told was interesting, captivating and one that explored themes in an interesting and meaningfull way? Well, that was about two decades ago and now all we got was a bunch of random scenes that estetically look like an Lord of the Rings world but which feel nothing like Lord of the Rings in regards to story.I am not a die-hard fan of Lord of the Rings, but even I consider it to be one of the best movie trilogies of all time. So naturally when I heard all the rumors and the controversy behind Rings of Power I wasnt surprised since everything Hollywood does this day has to push the Message. But, still I was curious to see if this show was going to be as bad as I was anticipating. And while its not, its still bad and a disgrace compared to Peter Jacksons trilogy.The prologue (if you can call it that) felt bland and generic with no thought put into it, let alone emotion. You basically get the same thing as in the trilogy only this time it lacks any of the captivating feel and tone The Fellowships had. Oh, and not to mention that Galadriel gets bullied by beings who we know are nothing like humans, neither in behaviour nor in life length. We then get a montage of Galadriel searching for Sauron that feels so rushed and boring. They even find Saurons mark which seems supiciously similar to his scepter and no one seems to know what the sign means. The rest of the episode is just showing random scenes of harfoots (which the show creators imply they are ancestors of Hobbits but look nothing like them) which apparently eat only vegetables and fruits. Again modern vegan ideology gets infused in what Tolkien wanted to be a mythology for England. And are you telling me that Hobbits began eating meat between the second and third age since their ancestors never ate something like that? How, why? We also get to know the humans and the romance between Bronwyn and that african american looking elf who wears short hair? What? He looks like he was cut using a modern hair cutting machine. Again elves as did humans and hobbits wore long hair and that wasnt just for fashion sake it was because that was what people looked in medieval times. No one could cut their hair in a modern style haircut. Not to mention Galadriels brother who looked like he came out of a contemporary haircut center. Now, I think its obvious this show focused more on the politically correctness rather than telling a good tolkinian story. Want more proof? What about african american looking elves, humans and harfoots? Was this how the elves, humans and hobbits looked like in Tolkiens world? He wanted to tell a mythology tale for England. That means he used races that resembled the great britain of the 11th century. Were there any african american people? Were there any races other than caucasian white, british looking people? No. So why modernize a tale made for 11th century England? Why cant the people who created this thing respect the most obvious things about Tolkiens world?Now, visually is the only way in which this show comes close to Tolkien world, but the rest is absolute trash dressed in pseudo-intelectual dialogue that tries in vain to appear tolkinian. The roles of characters are swaped with Elrond sitting home like women did in 11th century England and Galadriel going into war like men did back then. Everything that was logical about Tolkiens world has been subverted and perverted into this monster of a show that has nothing going on. You cant understand why the show focuses on men, harfoots and elves for its story. There is literally no single event that ties them together or suggests they are all part of a bigger game. Remember in Fellowship how everything was connected and how every character seemed to have a role in the bigger picture of good vs evil? Remember how the plot of that movie even in the extended editions was tight and knew when and how to be interesting while also introducing many characters? Remember how you understood within the first half an hour of the movie what the ring was, who Sauron was and why destroying the ring is the main focus of the story? Here, nothing happens for 55 minutes and then at the end a guy falls from the sky and Galadriels ship goes into some light, she jumps off and presumably stays alive in comparison to the other elves who are probably dead, who knows. Nah, nothing in this episode makes any sense because no effort has been put into the story and why is this story important. What does this show try to say thats interesting, captivating and resonates universally? As it appears it says nothing, it accompishes nothing.

not bad not good,"As a passerby, did not read the trailer, pure curiosity opened the first episode to see, did not turn on the sound to watch the end, it seems to be very good, putting aside the issue of actors, putting aside the fact that this is a Lord of the Rings story (it can be said that there is little connection with the original Lord of the Rings story.) It is the feeling of telling something is quite traditional road story, the narrative on the plot is no big problem, it can be said that the audience want to seem to have given, is a good video that can be clicked on after dinner to see, there is no deep logic, but it is easy to watch.Although I did not study the Lord of the Rings how deep, but to their own narrow perspective, the story seems to be a bit fragmented, the director has a lot of things to say but not expressed in place, the current TV series does not have any in-depth level of understanding of the story of the Lord of the Rings is very shallow.The abrupt transitions and lack of emotional buildup make it difficult for the audience to bring in the perspective of the characters and feel the grief of the characters.",linlsw,5,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,2
Confused,"I havent read the books, but I now the storyline quite well, is it only me or they actually concentrated over 2000-3000 years of history in 3 episodes, I mean Galadriel in the first episode is supposed to be at the start of the second age, then we see Celebrimbor who dies around 1600 SA, and now we have Elendil and Isildur who are born after 3000 SA... also we see Elrond going to meet with Durin IV who apparently lead the dwarves during the war of the last alliance but he was also born early enough to meet Celebrimbor ??

Only better because there is less story,"I can see many fans believe this is the best episode so far and I can understand why. It is more action packed, more focused and the ending is powerful, unexpected and intriguing. But the main reason why this episode feels better is simply because it is so action oriented, it is not hindered by the shortcomings of the horrendous writing. Ironically, since the story is practically non-existant and there is less dialogue, the episode turns out to be slightly better. There is one thing I really dislike about it though and its not the first time it happens. This episode makes Middle Earth feel so small compared to the books and the LotR trilogy. The sense of wonder and huge scope is totally gone. Armies can cross lands and countries in what seems to be hours. In a previous episode we saw a character getting lost in the middle of the ocean, deciding to swim back to land (!!) and encountering two ships in a short time. That was preposterous, but seeing an army cross hundreds of miles in a matter of hours is not much better. Also, we are supposed to be watching the biggest TV production ever, but battles feel small and restrained compared to what we saw in the films. I cant hate Rings of Power like some people do, it has some good things, but it is always underwhelming and even its best moments feel bland and half baked to me.",onirium,5,0.8235294117647058,No,Udûn,14,17

Do you really think that painfull love looks like nausea?The narration is very broken. No time to feel characters. Im familiar with the world, but it looks messy even for me.I really wish to get the world of LotR again, but it looks like it will be like a love between a hedgehog and cactus.So results:

"Well, she is good at staring at things...","Great CGI, defiantly award winning! If this was a view-scape I would have rated it 9/10, but the acting and convoluted royal sounding conversations were confusing at best, and tedious at worst.The entire production has a feeling of Chronicles of Riddick when it comes to depth and faux mythology.Morfydd Clark would play an excellent background character, but she simply doesnt convey the gravitas that a more experienced actress could. Give the young actress a few more years, and some big dramatic titles, and I suspect she would have fit the role well. I will say, she stares meaningfully at things very well.Its clear that this is a clumsy first step into an already trepidatious series.

A Shadow of Tolkien,"For all its lush landscapes and effect shots, the first episode was kind of unengaging. The elves lost their ethereal nature and become humans with pointy ears and super powers. There are some very modern looking hair styles here: Elrond looks like coming right out of a salon and Arondir sports a buzz cut with skin fade.Elrond is a political speech writer who writes for the High King Gil-Galad. You feel the Tolkien yet?The societies are so diverse this show may also happening on Times Square, which takes me out of Middle Earth to be quite frank. Please be more diverse but stick with the world the author built.Based on all the promo stuff they released I was ready to hate this series but now I can just say: meh. Walking on well-trodden paths, the Hobbit parts of the story feel unnecessary and copied from The Lord of the Rings. You have your Sam and your Frodo and people advise them not to stray too far. The swooning between Arondir and Bronwyn already gets on my nerves and Galadriel is an unlikable warrior super hero, abandoned by stupid men.So far we we get three story threads with headstrong independent females.

More disjointed than episode 2. Galadriel is all wrong,"Galadriel should be otherworldly, a bit mysterious, and in control.This Galadriel has no hold on her emotions (I realize she is younger, but shes an elf, they are supposed to be serenity incarnate). This Galadriel does not inspire awe and reverence, instead she is intemperate and unlikable.Rather than present the character as Peter Jackson did: a queen of grace and serenity who was in complete control, they present an irksome, uncontrolled, very human character.With all the hype about trying to present strong female characters in modern media, it seems like they completely missed the opportunity. The Galadriel of the books is a character of great strength and dignity. This rendition just seems like an angry bratty child throwing a tantrum. Instead of presenting a strong female character, they present many of the stereotypes that define women as being weak.While this episode does introduce some new places and some new characters, it feels forced, as if they are trying to draw the story out...I mean, they spent an inordinately long amount of time with a slow motion segment of Galadriel riding a horse...Im trying to give this show a fair shake, but theyre making it difficult.",psscootinfool,5,0.6065573770491803,No,Adar,37,61
"After the first two episodes, the show slowed down...","I had problems with the first 2 episodes - but despite them, I could still enjoy them.I was bored during watching this episode.The good parts:The CGI and costumes are good. Most of the costumes doesnt even remind me to anythig what is LOTR, but at least they look good. The orcs looked good as well, their movements, voices, the way they talk, their clothes were spot on. Númenor felt alive and massive. Aaand, thats it.The bad parts for me:I didnt like Númenor at all. Always wanted to see it and i was excited about it... but damn, it looks like as if someone would mix ancient greece and arabic styles together. At the first 2 episodes I could feel some middle earth vibes. When we saw Númenor and watched Galadriel and Halbrands scenes there, I completely forgot that this is something LOTR related. This ancient-real-life style is just very very far from Tolkiens world at least for me. I felt like im watching something else, an episode of Vikings or the Wheel of time at a mediterranian part of the world... Dont get me wrong, the design wouldnt be bad. The city was massive, we saw a lot of people duing stuff, it wasnt empty... but its not Númenor for me.Also, ISILDUR DIDNT HAVE A SISTER. Her character is totally pointless at this point: she literally did nothing what would make me like her or would made me insterested in her.Halbrand and Galadriels story is just mixed with Bards stroy from the Hobbit: - the guy just wants to restore his name because his family made a mistake, just like Bard with the dragon.On the other hand, it also similiar to Aragorns case: his people needs a king, so he has to be that, but he isnt sure about his own quality. It felt forced, boring, and looked like a obvious attempt to try make fans love the show, because sometimes its similiar to Peter Jacksons works...The slave-pit scene... ah, MORE average looking elves - if it wouldnt be the pointy ears, Id simply say that they are average humans. One of them was even looking 50 years old. Come on writers, elves look young, ethereal, angelic, was it hard to cast people like these? These guys barely lived 2 minutes on screen, their acting quality wouldnt even matter anyways.At this point the harfoots cant interest me anymore. They became boring, annoying even: they argue about pointless things, theyd leave behind someone when there are clearly enough people to help them pulling the cart, and they dont even have actual reasons to leave as soon as they can -.- Their looks is annoying as well. Why are they always dirty like hell and , and every single one of them is unsyphatic, except Nori and her friend?The istari storyline is too slow and at this point they didnt add more to the mystery. People will lose interest like this.And I guess the orcs big bad boss will be the evil elf... whats not a thing in the books. There is no elf who would serve or work with orcs at all.I just started to get into the show, but now im starting to lose hope again... and I can only hope that Im wrong.Also, Its funny that the episodes title was Adar.

Galadriel,She or more accurately her character and the writers are making it harder and harder to watch this show. She is rescued and then behaves like a petulant child? Her entire attitude during this show is ridiculous and way outside of the realm that Tolkien would have written her. The Tolkien heros and heroines were always at the very least polite to all those around them regardless (mostly) of the circumstances. This portrayal of the savior of Middle-Earth is hardly flattering. It is rather disappointing to see what they are doing to this fantastic world and story that was so meticulously written by one of the great writers.,faithless4734,5,1.0,No,Adar,3,3

All the actors were given a terrible script by two mediocre writers with no experience in something this grand. Its like giving a luxurious car to a toddler. Its a terrible shame. This show could have been something truly beautiful, the potential was there.I was trying to stay awake the whole time but nothing saved me from that. Some of the dialogue made me laugh.

Rings of Power - A Distorted Adaptation,"One thing should be mentioned foremost - if you are a fan of the Tolkiens lore you will probably not enjoy this episode.The Good:
Visually and sonically really well crafted. Music is very akin to Jacksons films. Grand, airy, inspiring tracks accompanied by stunning visuals.The Bad:
Highly variable acting quality. Dialogues feel pseudo-intellectual, allegories are force-glued together. Unlikable characters, especially the main protagonist. Very loosely following the source material if at all. The episode throws a bunch of characters at you all at once hoping that one sticks, but eventually you end up not caring for any one of the characters. Feels like the show doesnt know what its target audience should be. By trying to appeal to everyone they end up appealing to no one.Havent seen the second episode, I really wanted to like this show, but right now I have to say it has been avarage at most. A pretty cover without real substance.",reinoapse,5,0.3333333333333333,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,2,6
Honestly the first episode I didnt particularly enjoy,"The hate for this show is pretty misplaced, generally speaking. Hating it for having fictional beings is absolutely laughable. Hating it because this rendition of unpublished source material from Tolkien and his son is understandable, but really unwarranted. This is a show that is based on Peter Jacksons LotR trilogy, which is based on the books, using material from the Silmarillion as a reference, but unable to use it as source as the Tolkien estate (Christopher Tolkien, specifically) felt even the original Jackson trilogy was an evisceration of the source material by pandering to young adult men, fans of the action genre (I agree). So, if you want a reason to dislike this show for not being true to the source material, be mad at Peter Jackson for giving leaving the Tolkien estate with distaste after sensationalizing the novels.That said, viewing this series through an objective cinematic lens as a standalone series, untied to any works of fiction other than the films, its quite difficult to call this show good, but I definitely have a harder time calling this show bad. The fact of the matter is that there is a hokey, phoniness to the way the story is told. The MCU and Star Wars sequel trilogy (with the exception of The Last Jedi) are both recent, popular examples that also embody this folly. A good story doesnt need to tell you when to cry or laugh, the viewer picks up on the emotional cues by seeing how the actions affect the characters and will cry or laugh as a result, but bad story telling explains how the characters feel and telegraph to the audience how they should respond in turn. It may be my biggest gripe with modern cinema. I absolutely get more enjoyment out of a film or television show that presupposes the audience is at least a somewhat intelligent and somewhat emotionally intelligent, not babies who need everything explained to them or cartoonish levels of telegraphing to evoke a measured response. Its like these huge films and TV shows are written and filmed in front of focus groups or by an AI that assumes the cognition of the audience is equivalent to an adolescent. Its true that films or TV shows that give zero context or insight into the intended response are also harder to enjoy - nobody goes to the theatre particularly excited to see cinema that plays like an abstract painting with no insight given to the audience. There is such a thing as too avant garde, but thats really beside the point. The point is The Rings of Power is rather guilty of telegraphing exactly what feelings should be evoked by the audience, and that makes it less enjoyable for me.This episode was particularly guilty of that, and, without saying too much, it also fails on a narrative level as well. We are already aware (assuming no relevant knowledge of the characters existed before viewing the show), of who certain referenced characters are and what their purpose is within the bigger picture, but were constantly getting hit with narrative twists that humanize these (even in the context of just this show) otherworldly characters. I guess since Shyamalan, having huge narrative twists that make absolutely no sense within the context of the plot is cool? Well, its not, its bad writing and only people who are emotionally stunted would think these are meaningful, shocking twists. If I broke my arm and had a cast on for 6 months, the entire time causing myself stress and strain in not being able to use my dominant hand, gaining literally nothing other than an itchy arm, then after 6 months I suddenly revealed that it wasnt broken, I was just doing a bit, that would be extremely silly and nobody would take me seriously. Thats whats happening with the narrative here. Its simply bad.Beyond that, the cinematography and visuals are solid as usual. Nothing special, but definitely nothing bad. Even with the shocking twists that the showrunners are throwing at us, its still developing pretty well towards its conclusion, that I think the bigger picture of the narrative will eventually mitigate the bad storytelling.Overall, it ends up being subpar for what this shows given so far, Id even say it was worse than the previous episode, which also wasnt bad, but it was definitely more middling and boring than the rest of the show. 5.5/10.",unkommon,5,0.25,No,Alloyed,4,16
I think weve done here,"The second episode included all the negatives, which I assumed would be the theme - the absence of any immersion and the confused acting.They had a little more to show this time, and the dwarves were kinda cool. But closer to the end, red flags started showing - the pacing in some scenes made me want to fast-forward since there was nothing to latch onto.I gave this series all I could at this point, and since it could not hook me in two hours, I dont think I should continue.Dont get me wrong. I do not just hate for the sake of hate. I came open-minded and ready for something different, but there is nothing here.This series has everything money can buy but talent, immersion, interesting characters, and mysterious adventure.",kuarinofu,6,0.5555555555555556,No,Adrift,10,18
"An in-depth episode review. Summary: The plot thickens, some imperfections in the previous episode are course corrected as the action increases.","The arrival of a being from the sky builds up a new-found mystery while giving more insight into Noris psyche and character. Unfortunately this is delivered in a bit of a cliche generic writing which renders it not bad per se, but just weak. As usual, the show looks visually stunning but as soon as characters open their mouths the show heavily drops in quality. Its like eating a cake that looks delicious but tastes awful. The writing style is still lacking creativity and nuance and decides to keep explaining what we can clearly see. So it feels generic and not as creative as Tolkiens, who as an expert in the understanding and use of languages was able not only to invent new but also had the best grasp of its use and importance in literature. A dimension of the source material that is lost in this adaptation.This was no ground-shake, someone dug this passage
Some THING. Men didnt do this.Top tier mystery writing right here. How? How would this woman know what dug the hole. If the camera had panned to a claw mark or it had been previously shown she had any sort of skill to detect digs then it would have made sense. But there wasnt so here we are, with the show adding writing to the characters so all the hints are given to us instead of shown to us. And no shred of mystery or tense reveal is created, we are told what is attacking villages.And the scene is followed by yet another boring exposition scene with weak writing, that of Elrond in his new job. Surely it is nice to have an insight at this great evil that was Morgoth and also about an artifact only connoisseurs of the lore might identify. Used uniquely as an analogy of the duality of creation and destruction that always come hand in hand. Leading to the reveal of why Elrond was sent there instead of the heavy work force needed for such an interesting project. Whatever that means, I hope it is revealed further in the season or show and hopefully itd be for more than access to Elronds friends.The hammer test scene however, plays out nicely with a theme never before explored really: the age and life of Elves and how that can affect their perception of time. Elronds inability to tangibly realize that for others time passes quicker. Life is shorter and Prince Durin has not only married but had not one but two children and Elrond had missed the chance to witness such unique fleeting moments. As a side note, I have a small nitpick, the dwarves seem too tall. Or perhaps Elves are too short, because I swear Elrond is only one head taller than Durin. Idk, guess I thought thered be smaller and more squished down but thats just my own preference. Eitherway, this story thread ends with a nice dinner scene featuring the introduction of Prince Durins wife, Disa. Here some of the better writing for Elrond takes place, cementing him in my mind as an interesting character at least for this entire subplot. So far he seemed like a side character to Galadriel but if hes to be one of the main characters that changes everything. Actor reminds me of Neil Patrick Harris but other than that I have no other complaints for now.As we see more interactions between Nori and the strange man from the sky, we begin to realize because the show isnt particularly hiding the fact that its heavily implying this man is actually Gandalf. The cloak she gives him, his overall physical appearance and the interaction where he doesnt know who Nori initially is, is a dead give away as it is executed exactly the same as Fellowship of the Ring when Bilbo accuses Gandalf of wanting the ring for himself. If it turns out its not Gandalf thats also okay for me but it does kinda look like it would be a magical being so perhaps hed be another wizard I dont know about. Again, not super versed in the LOTR lore.The sequence with the worm is interesting. Some film making decisions dont make much sense for me, like the extreme abundance of eye close ups. They make a scene in a vast space that is an ocean to be very claustrophobic, which Im not sure if it was done on purpose. As for the turn of events, it is refreshing to see men as well as women hate Galadriel equally, granted it is mainly because of her kind and the fact that they blame her for bringing the beast to them. But then the handsome guy separates from them to survive and helps Galadriel and the biggest display of humanity is shown by her. Finally empathizing with another as an equal. And like he said, At last, a little honesty. We are finally let into the mind of Galadriel, who so far has only been grumpy and rebellious against his own characters development, demanding answers but never responding to questions aimed at her. Whether it was planned or not as such, this comes in the nick of time bringing with it a bit of hope that shed be fleshed out more as the banter and tension between both characters builds up.Another great tension building scene ensues after, with the reveal of the orcs. One which cleverly involves the subversion introduced earlier with mice. I like the way this encounter with the orcs takes place, it uses elements of horror which is suited for raising the stakes and making the orcs more like horror creatures and less like the bad guys minion. Also I like the cool transition when she cuts its head, snappy editing.IN CONCLUSION, the plot thickens as the story continues and the elements presented in episode 1 are developed a bit more. Some threads develop into interesting quests and some characters are more fleshed out which makes them more engaging. It was the much needed redirection and runtime that would build on what was established. In some aspects I was too quick to judge episode 1 where I should have waited and see where it was headed towards. And the episode leaves some intriguing mysteries too, specifically the Sword with the brand of Sauron. However, while episde 2 is more event-heavy and characters are developed further; it doesnt take too much of its time in presentation when its needed. I recall only one establishing scene where we get a panoramic view of the mines of Moria but thats about it. These types of establishing scenes are mainly for introduccing new settings and characters but it doesnt have to end there, in episode 1 sequences and beautifully framed shots allowed the moment to breath and for us to relish it and sit on the emotional tone of it. But these are hard to master and if used abundantly or incorrectly can lead to pacing issues. So its best it stayed as such, besides this episode had a lot more action that require more of the runtime.",quiqueperezsoler,6,0.7142857142857143,Yes,Adrift,10,14
No reviews yet?,"(No big spoilers.)Well, this second episode continues in the same style as the first one. Its too early for me to say much, but I will keep watching and potentially adjust this review. So: Nori and Poppy take care of the stranger, Galadriel continues her quest (though she is not supposed to), we meet Celebrimbor, we see dwarves, even a female dwarf (will she have a beard?), there is a potential romance between an Elf and a human ... Some not-so-friendly creatures appear, so there is some suspense ... I dont have much of an opinion yet, but I will remain open-minded. Basically I am just writing this review because there is none so far and I want to let you know that the second episode is essentially like the first one, so dont expect any big shift in tone or whatever.",doenerfabi,6,0.3602941176470588,Yes,Adrift,49,136
A significant step up from the underwhelming pilot,"Actually found quite a bit of enjoyment out of it. Prince Durin and his wife were great additions and I loved the dialogue between them and Elrond. Nori continues to be my favorite character so far, and the scenes she had with that strange man from the fireball were fascinating. Arondir and Bronwyn grew on me this episode, and I even found Bronwyns son to be entertaining. Some really good suspense moments throughout as well. Low point for me is Galadriels story line. I dont find her likeable at all, and have no idea how she is gonna turn out to be the Galadriel we all love from Jacksons films.I was so surprised by the difference in quality from the first and second episode, that I checked the writer for the 2nd, and low and behold, she was previously a BCS and BB writer. Doesnt surprise me that I found this episode to be much stronger.It was a very good idea for Amazon to drop both episodes because if they dropped that 1st episode only, then I probably wouldve let this go by the wayside.",ryanrodr,6,0.5126903553299492,No,Adrift,101,197
Best Episode but still falls short of mark,"I felt the storyline from this episode had been one of the the 3rd or 4th in the series and then build up from there. So much fluff wasted on viewers leading up to this point. The story continues to have gaps and is disjointed. It does leave me excited or looking forward to the next season. I dont feel attached to any characters. I was hoping for a season that got me excited and on the edge of my seat at times, but even this episode failed to achieve that, as did all the others before it. The characters of Galadriel and Elrond would have carried far more respect and admoration if the storyline from this episode had been in the series much sooner.",mn-idaho,6,0.45454545454545453,No,Alloyed,5,11

It is only really let down by shaky camera work, which is always triggering for some people when it is obviously not an intense or action filled scene.The press coverage suggested said they wanted to put their own spin on the works, but they should at least honour the source material, or it simply seems like a mindless cash grab.

Everyone who has ever read fantasy knows dwarf women have beards, everyone that is apart from the people working on this show, who seem to care more about themselves than about the world they are portraying.Not a bad episode, but its not tolkien.",AnonymousCritic,6,0.4444444444444444,No,Adrift,4,9
Review,"The series is excellent, it really has a lot of quality, a lot of attention was paid to the details, some scenes and scenes leave you speechless, magical, when you only compare it with other series of this genre, which rarely can boast of such scenes and such music. In general, we immediately set high expectations, because this is a famous trilogy that is loved by the whole world, and with which many grew up, but we should have understanding, and give space to these people, it is impossible to surpass Tolkien. The plot has to go slower than others expectations in order to leave space and material for the development of all the characters, and to somehow get that budget back (lol). A lot of criticisms related to episode 7 are correct, it says that realistically this episode was worse than the others, you cant in the penultimate episode not make any plot, you always need something that will make people look forward to the next episode, this (episode 7 ) leaves indifference, but certainly one should not write off or reduce the value of the series because of one bad episode.",milicapetrovic-32323,6,0.0,No,The Eye,0,1
The episode came to extinguish the glare of the previous episode. new failure.,"I think after the episode full of excitement and action and the details of the amazing battle, we returned again to the slowness of the events and the disjointed and dispersed situations.One of the strangest things is that no famous leader or hero died after the catastrophe. He returned completely, complete, and happy in the end.Unfortunately, the episode, instead of building on the distinction of the previous episode, came back to bury the achievement that happened and once again revealed to us how bad the story is.Im going to give this episode a 6/10, which I think is the most well-deserved rating.",AtlanticPirateK,6,0.4666666666666667,No,The Eye,7,15
Underwhelming.,"Yet again, after the narrative momentum finally picked up in The Rings of Power last week, todays episode grinds to another painful halt &amp; begins trudging along at such a slow pace, its astonishing to see a show of this grandeur &amp; cost succeed only in being boring, especially considering how momentous the event it continues on from (the long awaited eruption of Mount Doom) is supposedly meant to be within the lore of Tolkiens fantasy.Additionally, when the previous installment ended with such a game changing plot twist... For the impact of this explosion depicted on screen to be fairly insignificant does unintentionally undermine the stakes of its own storytelling, since characters elsewhere are basically unaffected; this is the formation of Mordor... And taking in to account just how important thats been hyped up to be thus far, the immediate ramifications of this development are surprisingly trivial - thus, hindering the audiences emotional investment as there seems to be very little risk posed to our ensemble of characters, irrespective of how the landscape / power dynamics shifts.Granted, the cinematography was admittedly beautiful in the sequences set within the smoky confines of the burning village but besides that, I cant help but feel as though its culminated to form another missed opportunity. Plus, I was willing to suspend my disbelief &amp; buy in to the concept of an elf surviving the temperatures of a pyroclastic flow - but an entire town of humans too? Nah. Theyd be dead.",W011y4m5,6,0.6764705882352942,Yes,The Eye,23,34
Snoarfest.,"What a missed opportunity. Last weeks episode had its flaws but was overall brilliant. This weeks episode is completely different and is incredibly slow with some awful dialogue. The harfoots need to just hurry up and be written off the show. They constantly contradict each other, saying how they stick by each other but in reality they leave their own behind if their not quick enough to die. There is no action what so ever in this episode. Boring scenes of people just walking. It has to be said that galadriel really is the worst leading character in recent memory. So unlikeable. Things happen in this show with no explanation. The three witches finally get some screen time and they really do come off as an off brand ring wraiths rip off. Its just such a pity that the penultimate episode is such a let down. It is the first time in recent memory that a huge TV show like this one uses its penultimate episode as a filler episode. I cant believe a billion dollars has been spent on this writing. The fact that Im a huge LOTR fan is keeping me interest ed but this episode falls flat and kills all sense of excitement. Very dissapointing. Im praying that next week makes up for this week.",aodhanmulholland14,6,0.7183098591549296,No,The Eye,51,71
Season One Review,"I put off watching season one of The Rings of Power, whilst House of the Dragon was on, because I was worried that my fantasy bandwidth wasnt wide enough for both shows simultaneously. Ive caught up with the show now and, though it improved as the season went on, for the gargantuan cost of it, at times it struggled to keep my attention.Looking to avenge her brothers death, and fearful of the rise of a new evil, Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) forgoes the departure of her Elven clan and stays in Middle Earth to search for it. She meets Halbrand (Charlie Vickers) and believing him to be the long-lost king of the humans, travels with him to the mainland. Elrond (Robert Aramayo) goes to see his old friend Prince Durin, a dwarf, but finds a welcome less hospitable than he hoped. Meanwhile a stranger (Daniel Weyman) falls from the sky and meets the Brandyfoot family.If Im honest, I struggled to maintain much interest in the first few episodes of the show. Its a similar, who are they again? problem that House of the Dragon has, though not compounded by swapping performers every episode. I would say that I still found HOTD the more compelling though. Rings of Power has a large cast, telling a series of plots that I knew would come together but, I feel it didnt balance the stories correctly. I understand that one of the criticisms that Tolkiens estate had for the Peter Jackson films were that the stories were boiled down to their action scenes. For me, a man who seen all those films, but never read any of the books - this series was too far the other way, generally lacking in spectacle, even when it arrived at its battle scenes.I dont know enough about the Tolkien stories to be upset by any of the inaccuracies or contradictions that Rings of Power apparently has, so Im judging this on nothing but my own feelings about its entertainment value. Ill be back for season two, but this first season is average at best.",southdavid,6,0.0,No,Alloyed,0,4
First to review?,"It seems the story is taking a step back from the written material. Seems there is some wonky editing going on here as well. The reveal of the main antagonist this early felt a bit cheap, would have liked a longer arc for Halbrand. Also the teleports? And mystery man is Gandalf? Seems like they took the easy way out here. A unknown blue wizard and his adventures would have been cooler. Seems they did the old Star Wars mistake and made the old remake of Gandalf and a Hobbit on adventure again.It is still a gorgeous show, environments and all is great. Interesting how this will keep going for five seasons, will it just be CGI fighting for the rest?",stonearrack,6,0.2727272727272727,Yes,Alloyed,3,11
Best episode by far,"This was easily the best episode of the season. Its somewhat hindered by being saddled with the weaker writing of the previous episodes, more of the poor dialog, and a desire to cram some of Tolkiens popular characters together, but... as a whole, it was a good episode.If youve stuck with Rings of Power this long, Alloyed (not a great name, imo) should be entertaining and the high point of the season. Our protagonist still has some issues, but the pacing was good, there was some intrigue, and even the main mystery box is handled pretty well.I wish the rest of the episodes had been more like this (but, please, stop trying to spin silly metaphors out of every other line of dialog).Hopefully season 2 will be more like S1E8.",bradclayton,6,0.3333333333333333,No,Alloyed,4,12
"S1: Unworthy of bearing the same name as Jacksons LOTR, not a disaster but just mediocre","There was obviously going to be a racist backlash to color-blind casting, because even if Tolkein had impeccable liberal beliefs in private, the unchallenging, simplistic morality of the races and the story itself can very neatly fit into all sorts of right wing fantasies (cf the incoming Italian PM who is a big fan and also a direct descendant of fascists). But what is the point of doing color-blind casting if you do casting thats not very good? There are no memorable characters or performances, the most decent ones are by Clark and Aramayo doing Galadriel and Elrond respectively, but most of the others are complete ciphers. Theres lots of callbacks to the movies, the dialogue is wooden algorithmic stuff and theres lots of boring stuff seen a million times before. An average fantasy show, aimed mostly at kids, on a very big budget.",TheSpiritOfTheTimes,6,0.2857142857142857,No,Alloyed,6,21
"Slight improvement, but still not sold","As some other people have pointed out this episode it quite a bit better then the previous episode but still nothing that will sell it to people who still have their doubts about the series.Still some big adaptational changes. Most people have already made their clickbait youtube video about Dwarf woman and the fact that they dont have beards. Im actually almost ok with this but it just gives me the thought of producers sitting in a boardroom discussing that Bearded woman would look weird and could possibly alienate some ethnicities/religions who would be offended with it and that offending Tolkienist would be a lesser evil. But whatever, its mainstream entertainment and that just how it works so whatever.What I found more vexing was when they told the story of Morgoth and the Silmarils and how their beauty nearly turned him from evil. Which is such a gigantic departure from Morgoth characterisation for no apparent reason. The Silmarillion makes it very clear that Morgoth only wants them since he cant create beautiful things for himself (Evil cannot create it can only mock as we have all had shoved down our throat for the last couple months on anything related to Rings of Power) and because they have the light of the trees in them, or in laymans terms he wants to steal the light/pride of the eldar. Whenever he sees something or someone else who is fair/beautiful he grows jealous and seeks to destroy/corrupt/dominate it. Maybe its meant to show that Celebrimbor is ignorant to the dangers of creating someting of immense beauty/might which will lead to him becoming a banner (if you get this reference, I raise my glass to you) but still, since I dont know which direction the serie will go it just seems so wrong to me. Well see if this part pays off (while it might seem strange that I just ranted like a lunatic about 2 lines of dialogue. But it really stood out to me).As many have mentioned the scenes with the dwarves are a standout with some great acting and amazing effects and the southlands scenes are also good. Galadriel scenes are whatever and the stoors plot is a big whatever despite some fine acting. It feels way to detached from the rest of the series to actually make an impression. Maybe it will grow on me but for now it feels like a part they shoved in so they can have hobbits in the show.Despite some improvements the show still feels average and with next episode most likely introducing a new subplot Im afraid that the show will eventually lose its focus.",leonhardwalhout,6,0.6666666666666666,No,Adrift,2,3
An ok final to a very average season,"So here we are, the final episode of the first season of Rings of Power - and my first reaction was.... so thats it then? I havent hated the show as much as many have, but I havent been a fan of it either. Its been painfully average throughout, with bland unrelatable characters, muddled story, awful and contradicting writing. The final episode follows the exact same formula as the previous ones. While I will give this episode props, it was paced very well. It was on for over an hour, and it didnt feel like it dragged. The visuals, music, cinematography and action scenes were really good in this finale. The fight between those 3 witches (I dont know what they are actually supposed to be) was really cool. That was the best scene in the episode. Im glad the episode decided to focus on the more interesting characters; Nori and the Stranger, Galadriel (shivers) and Halbrand, while ignoring the awful human and elf love story.While the final episode was ok, the episode tries too hard to seem smart and try to subvert out expectations. No writers are showrunners, we saw those twists coming a mile off. You arent fooling anyone. When I look back at the season as a whole, I ask myself - what actually happened? No character developed over the course of the entire season, no character changed or progressed. Countless pointless storylines. This season was a complete mess. Like I said, I didnt hate it, I thought it was fine, but I understand the hate it gets and the hate is well deserved. The cast and crew have been attacking the viewers harshly for speaking facts. I do hope that the showrunners and writers improve upon the mistakes they made with this season, and make the second season much better. Because a show that has a budget like this, should have been amazing, especially considering The Lord of the Rings is one of the most legendary stories ever created. This show should have been groundbreaking. They need to fix these issues for season 2, or more and more people will check out - if they havent already. I will keep watching, in hopes that it gets better, since the orignal trilogy of movies are the greatest movies ever created.All in all, this final episode was alright, nothing too amazing. The twists were very predictable, the characters still bland, the story still muddled. But the season was fine. Thats about it. Cmon Amazon, we all know you can make good TV shows, improve on this.",Dannyboi94,6,0.3333333333333333,No,Alloyed,5,15
So much potential,"I have tried so hard to like this show. Im not saying the show needs to be cancelled, but all of the writing for story and dialogue needs to change as soon as possible.Everytime a character died or was wounded, I was neither concerned nor feeling any sadness. I found myself lacking absolutely any investment in these characters. In fact, there were a few I had hoped would be cut as they dragged down the show with their stale story and their confusing motivations and development. This episode was also filled with a hand full of situations in which characters made the most senseless actions with no explanation.The fighting is subpar at best. I wish they would focus more on strategies and combat than trying to impress us with unnecessary acrobatics, flips, and spins. They are not confusing the enemy with these motions, only the audience.I dont hate this show. And Im not telling you to not watch it, you may like it! But the reviews that give this show a 9 or 10 stars is absolutely inaccurate. Its very disappointing to see Amazon pump this project full of so much cash and the biggest take-away is the scenery. You have some big shoes to fill, but Im rooting on you to see what mistakes you made to craft this show into something that is deserving a 9 to 10 stars.",Niik_Flix,6,0.46153846153846156,No,Alloyed,6,13
A bit slow and disappointing,"Watching the final episode Ive really appreciated the mammoth task Amazon has in producing this series. Its all based on tiny details that havent been extrapolated for the films, plus a lot of made up story lines that are going to be eeked out for what, four more series?So it wasnt a surprise then that there was o real action to speak of, albeit a disappointing death of my favourite Half foot.We find out after a rather unconvincing false flag, that the stranger is a good wizard, having nearly been conned into believing he was Sauron. I didnt believe it for one second. Although I was slightly caught off guard by who is actually the dark Lord. We dont yet know if the stranger is Gandalf, or Saruman. Could be either, though my money is on Gandalf still, although he does have Sarumans nose.I was slightly let down by the ending. The elves make three rings. Fine. But why were the credits lyrics singing about the 12 rings, and one ring to rule them all? It kind of undermines the end scene when we havent even gotten to the twelve rings being made. Maybe its a subtle plug for the second series but I think aside from it being beautifully sung, it was the wrong choice as its basically a spoiler. A bit like if they remade Titantic and the opening song lyrics chorus of she sinks and everyone dies.The series overall is nice but I accept it has to be slow paced if Amazon are going to get their moneys worth out of the rights. Which also makes the elongated plot lines somewhat cynical. But I look forward to series 2 all the same.",tcecoleshaw,6,0.46153846153846156,Yes,Alloyed,12,26
Season one The Rings Of Power tends to bury itself in the depths of Khazad-dûm,"Season one was a big mistakeThis series will bury itself into depths of Khazad-dûm if they keep making the same mistakes they did so far, and if they dont find themselves and stop mimicing Peter Jacksons trilogy, take responsibility to put in the effort - if they can.The reason why I think Rings of Power is doomed to fail is because the show is unstable and fragile, and that could be unsustainable in the long run. Here is why:I dont understand why Amazon chooses to buy the rights for the books of the Third age, when they are making the show about the Second age? I know there are some writings about the Third age even there, but it seems that they dont care, because they dont even follow the lore at all.So now, making something out of nothing its like shooting in the dark, and it becomes even more painful when you realize that the hired writers and directors are uncapable to make a good show, they feel so unoriginal and without any creativity. On the other hand, community hates the Rings of Power for multiple reasons, one of them is because it is not true to the lore, and it can never be, because Amazon has nothing to work with. Chooses not to. For me it does not entirely need to be true to the lore even a bit, as long as it has a good quality writing followed by seriousness, good logic, writing and timings, (and this unfortunately is not the case here). Those can only be accomplished only with dedication, love, creativity, and good inspiration, but not senselessly and with imitation of Jacksons work, that indicates only a lack of innovation, imagination and originality.In the opening it started with quick jumps from one plot to another, following the stories of fictional characters that no one knows anything about, and they failed in the attempt to bring them closer to us and make us care about them.Poor writing. The dialogues are shallow, feels like its without Tolkiens depth and wisdom. The Elves seem so superficial without depth and wisdom, bearing in mind that they are thousands of years old, and do not look like elves at all, and Galadriel seems like a spoiled brother filled with anger towards Sauron, the uniformly presented enitity of the embodiment of evil.Actors are allowed to act with a stiff face, without any solid facial expression. Acting gets somehow better with Hallbrand, Durin or Nori on the scene, even Elrond, it feels natural with them, realistic, it immerses you, you can see emotions and effort. However, the decisions the characters make depend on the writing of the story, and the writings of the story depends on the writers, and many of them are bad. Like the decision to leave the fortress on the hill and to defend themselves from the orc attack from the village, or the decision for no one to check what was under the cloth they took from Adar.The timings are bad, some scenes should have been allowed to develop longer or shorter, in order to feel full and realistic, for example (the cave troll thing) which overly glorified Galadriel needed to be more real and longer, make snow troll harder to kill, to make companion take the effort of killing togheter, and lastly - with her making the last blow. Way too short. Or the scene when Arondir and other humans gets stuck in Tavern to heal themselves while awating the orc attack, it was way to long.Gandalf looks foolish, the line he utters (I am good) while casting his powers on Saurons minions is so cringeworthy, foolish, and make me feel ashamed for them - the directors who allowed such an idiotic line, what a childish decision.So they allow such important scenes to end quickly, and lets say the departure from Numenor to last so long and boring. The entire fifth episode is a deadlock, because it should have already been dedicated to the Numenoreans and their landing in Middle-earth, so they would somehow manage to justify the rapid arrival of the cavalry to help. It just came out kind of rash like this.Yes, the cinematography is astonishing, and the world looks beautiful. Numenor and Kazhaddom bouth looks fantastic, but that is not enough.",ken-gcritique,6,0.4782608695652174,Yes,Alloyed,11,23
"An in-depth episode review. Summary: Nevermind, this show is dumb. Mysteries that never were, are revealed and we learn nothing new. All while conveniences are the solution","SPOILERS AHEAD AND HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE EPISODE WITHOUT THEM -- Note I wrote this as I was watching the episode as a sort of real time (live) reaction review.Welcome folks, welcome to the episode of lets rush everything because we wasted the first half of the season building up things. In the span of 10 minutes, we get three major story threads solved in an instant: any speculation of who Sauron was (allegedly for now), who these white women are AND who this stranger who fell from the sky may be is solved in the first 2 minutes of the episode without build up nor climactic reveal; story thread 2: right after we see Elrond meet with Galadriel with a swift salute and not a slight of physical emotional reaction to seeing one of his closest friends not only be there but also alive after he thought she had gone to Valinor forever (which was built up and presented as a sort of Valhalla, a place for her to spend the rest of her days as compensation for her service), theres no time to waste because we got to keep the plot going. Thirdly, the entire subplot of Celebrimbor and the mithril is fixed by a guy who was seemingly dying, gets better in what could have been a longer span of time but because the show now has no time to waste has rushed through that period to have us see how he approaches a table and does the equivalent of Good Will Huntings solving-the-equation-in-the-blackboard by literally saying the solution to the the mithril problem... After he says his humble wisdom cant be compared with that of the famous and acclaimed Celebrimbor, master of craft. Man, what a promising start!Why is Galadriel ALWAYS so untrusting? It is tiresome to have a main character who befriends no one, who trusts no one but those who she already knew (Elrond). She distrusted the people of Numenor, their Queen at first, Elendil at first,.. Basically everyone she encounters until they prove her wrong. And now, after she had distrusted Halbrand when she met him, then he proved her wrong and actually became friends (if such a thing is possible for Galadriel), now she all of a sudden distrusts him and to us Halbrand is now presented as... Shady? The show sides with this character reaction, it seems like all we see with Galadriels scenes is her subjective point of view when the show should remain impartial. All of a sudden Halbrand is sleazy and distrusting, why?And in the same vein as the spirit of this episode, we also get the fastest tracking in existence by a group of halflings, who supposedly not only fell behind in going after the stranger from the sky, but also have shorter legs. Not only did they catch up to the mysterious white-cloaked beings too but managed to stay hidden and not be bothered by the hurricane the allegedly revealed Sauron creates around the vicinity... I give up. I mean, this is certainly more nitpicky than an actual mistake, but it only shows the subpar quality of the most expensive show ever made. Where did the money go? Where? Thank god at least these beings had noticed their presence and the scene went down how I expected it to. The day three smelly, short and clumsy halflings are able to sneak past who seem like superior beings without just but an owl whistle is the day I throw away my sanity and disbelief for the show.I dont think the man from the sky is actually Sauron, I think its a wizard and they have mistaken him. The lighting in Noris speech to Gandalf is wrong... the contrast is too low, like super low for being in a night setting lit by a surrounding fire. Its fake and devoid of drama and tragedy, making the tone of the scene subpar. And how is Sadoc still alive? He was just stabbed in the stomach but is now fighting and standing and everything. Wow.... Not only does Gandalf can speak now to destroy these beings but... second twist! HE IS NOT SAURON, HE IS THE OTHER (someone called Istar) so it didnt take me long to be right. It never felt natural to me that this guy was Sauron, no matter how his arc could have gone downhill in the following seasons. But now its obvious who Sauron is... Halbrand. His mysterious origin, his probably false made up past, what he has on that pouch, why he is so drawn to power, gems and crafting.Meanwhile, in the ships back to Numenor, the Queen doesnt want to be patronized. Chill the f out, Elendil just wanted to help jeez. Also, its not dramatic that she had to ask what Elendil saw 3 times; its just plain annoying. And this is all I have to say about Numenors scenes.At the How do they do it? TV episode: Halbrand yet again comes up with the solution to why things arent working. Rendering Celebrimbors contribution to the show to be... useless? What does this character provide to the show other than emotional reactions to things he has no control over? All while Galadriel attempts to stop the creation of whatever it is they are doing and havent yet explained to us why or what reasons she has to distrust Halbrand all of a sudden.There are two ways of doing a prequel to a famously good story. One, you make a story that takes place WAY before anything related to the current timeline, therefore cutting any and all contrivances and sprinkling only references to it but telling a new story with new characters which never suffer the comparison test nor the accuracy one. For instance: House of the Dragon, which takes place so far in the past there is no risk of altering or upsetting the fanbase for altering historical events nor characters that can be found in Game of Thrones. Or, you do exactly the opposite. Like RIngs of Power, which happen so close to the events that unfold in their main storyline that is LOTR, that the resolution of everything turns out to be just too... convenient. Thats the word: convenient. Rings of Power ends with a series of contrived and convenient decisions that make all the pieces fall into place no matter the narrative consistency, just for the sake of puting things in place for the events to come; which I will diligently list as they permeate through the episode but are noticeably rushed in the last third of it:
1. The new-found mystery of Halbrands identity who is again put into question when it had been sort of resolved for the time being is rushed to its inevitable conclusion: he is Sauron. Its so rushed it comes across as it came out of nowhere, like a bad cartoon villain, he smirks and monologues his plan to Galadriel as he enchants her.2. Galadriel goes to Celebrimbor and tells him to stop what he is doing because Halbrand was evil but he doesnt say why or whats his connection with anything. And not only is it really convenient that the closest city Galadriel could have brought Halbrand to be cured is precisely the one where Elrond and Celebrimbor are building the very weapon that was going to be used to destroy him; but his injuries are cured instantly, he solves any and all obstacles in the creation of what they never refer to as the rings of power. Galadriel COMMANDS him to stop, doesnt reveal her mission and doesnt answer Elronds questions because she doesnt trust Celebrimbor, and she commands him to make 3 rings so they dont divide and whatever (like in the lore), and which shall only be crafted by elves (like in the lore), and no more shall be created (like in the lore). What authority has Galadriel that would allow her to order around people that are not under her command and why would anyone obey or believe her? If they are really crafting the weapon to save the elves and kill the enemy why is her word the dutifully followed command?3. And the final convenience is that Celebrimbor now knows how to make the rings but it requires gold and silver from Valinor. How are we to fix this problem? No worries, Galadriel has in her hand her brothers dagger: which is conveniently made of gold and silver from Valinor, has an emotional meaning to her and she has conveniently never lost throughout the many perils she has endured and which she has wielded against Sauron just 2 minutes ago. Wow, how convenient! Also, Wow, the Elves rings of power were made in 3 weeks, how impressive! And cathartic. Are you going to tell me they have to melt Galadriels dagger? Is there NO MORE GOLD OR SILVER FROM VALINOR in this massive golden-detailed city of a culture that traditionally and trendily use gold and gems as decor and to accessorize everything? Is time running out that fast that you gotta make the rings like now, like right now because we cant take two minutes to acknowledge that Halbrand was Sauron all along and he just left (they could possibly catch him but, again, we have no time frame of what happened after Galadriel was enchanted nor do we know how long did the charm last; and therefore we dont know how far away he could have gotten) but rather we must built this right now without questioning if he has corrupted the furnace or without reevaluating any of what just happened and they have been doing...Back with the Halflings: What? He can talk now? Why... Oh, bother! Also, he remembers, can recall and can comprehend things and people. And Istar means Wizard. Here we have it folks, the first wizard (I suppose) and yet another throwaway line to give away and confirm that this wizard is Gandalf: Always follow your nose. A direct reference to Gandalfs line from the lore. And finally, bye Nori, you are part of something bigger now, it was so predictable and yet it feels.. unearned. But just like most of this show. Cute backpack too, super useful when it rains and also intelligently crafted to not let things fall out of it.IN CONCLUSION, two words define this show: subpar and contrived. It sets mysteries that were never secret, it never rose to the occasion nor met its budget with a worthy cinematic quality. It resulted in a bland, averagely enjoyable show that never attempts to redefine anything nor pay respect to the legacy of his writer. Some have called it an antithesis...",quiqueperezsoler,6,0.45454545454545453,Yes,Alloyed,20,44
What a mess,"What a disappointing ending to a series from which you had expected so much - but maybe its exactly this expectation that makes the last episode in particular so incredibly boring, empty and sad. The dialogue is so unimaginative and uncreative that it makes you wonder what the writers and producers did with all the money they were given. One of the most expensive series of all time? You only notice that in pictures and music. The rest is actually a dramaturgical catastrophe. Im a big Lord of the Rings fan, and I still find Tolkiens creativity simply stunning. Unfortunately, what was made of the fabric is not good. The chance was there.",DLochner,6,0.5833333333333334,No,Alloyed,7,12
Great at moments and past potential but...,"The show has real potential, next season, once the poor dialog narration to explain to the audience by characters giving each other short mologue back stories or explaining to the viewer, oh I mean the other character, whats happening, but right now Ive paused it at the 57:49 mark of this second episode. Nori is telling her friend Poppy that Gandalf, (The Stranger) which is not a spoiler, and really my opinion, I guess it could be Gandalfs father? But the show makes it obvious from the first few minutes of his intro, by looming trees towards Nori, whispering to fireflies,
and well, its Gandalf... regardless, the main problem(s) with the show so far the production team drowns the viewers in practically EVERY scene in over the top music for both Emotional effect and to move the slow scenes along. The wide shots of each city introduced with that overwhelming music at a feverish pitch instead detracts from the awe, rather than builds it. Id be okay with that, if the very scene before (every scene before) hadnt used that same dramatic music for a character picking berries or saying hello, again drowning out that scene, so when the big scenes do happen they lose that awe inspiring effect. Another issue is casting, some characters, or acting, depends on how you look at it, as one character is important but the actor and poor acting detracts. I SHOULD feel both nostalgic and excited to see a character from the films or books (Ive read them all) but I feel nothing because i can tell you none of the actors I think read the books or watched the movies, except Morfydd Clark, she watched at least the scenes with Galadriel and they zoom in on her eyes, and shes good at making the same stares at other characters as Cate Blanchett did in the films, but somehow they need to recast Elrond or lengthen and darken his hair, idk what they were thinking in casting this actor to play him. Prince Durin was a great casting choice and he plays a Dwarf well. Im not going to list every character, but its about 50/50 if the character, or actor, is a hit or a miss. Its like the show spent 90% of the budget on CGI, and music, but then realized the half a billion was spent so they gathered the local town people, where they filmed, and the nearest Shakespearian theater troupe to play almost every character but Galadriel and a couple others. My last issue is that these characters are supposed to be literal Legends from the books and movies, yet each is introduced as ho-hum, no big deal, oh theres just Elrond sitting in a tree, Galadriel (having been introduced as a child) is casually, mourning her brother, while Gandalf, I mean The Stranger comes flying from SPACE, because youre mislead to almost think it could be Sauron with the fire and lava at the end of episode one, who then acts feeble and mad (insane) digging at the dirt in the next, like a peasant from Monty Python. Id wish theyd pause the show, fix the sound score, re-edit for better effect and story telling, but likely the first season will play out through the 8 episodes, and hopefully they will figure out the issues and it will get better in the second season.

deviating from the books already,"Why were the Peter Jackson films, Game of Thrones or The Expanse such a huge succes? Because they stayed true to the books as best they could.Why are Wheel of Time and Foundation such a total failure? Because they totally ignored the books. Yes, they too had a ridiculous budget and therefore great visuals, but that is all they have.I am not 10 minutes into this series and already they deviate from the books. This is looking to become a personal feud between Galadriel and Sauron. In the whole of the Silmarillion Galadriel is barely even mentioned. Here Galadriel (and Elrond) are portrayed like a couple of teenaged elf-brats. And while Elrond at the start of the second age is still young, Galadriel is already many, many centuries old, perhaps even then the eldest living elf remaining in Middle-Earth. She will become Elronds mother-in-law later on, not to mention that she is a (great)-aunt to the high king Gil-Galad, not some insignificant underling who has to BEG the snot-nosed teen Elrond for an audience with the king, only to be sent away by said king. Furthermore, if im not mistakenm the Noldor were at that point still banished from Valinor by Mandos, so it was not up to Gil-Galad to send anyone back there.I realise 95% of viewers have not read the Silmarillion or the collection of lost tales so for the bulk of them this is a perfectly fine adaptation. But why do showrunners always think they know better? Perhaps its and Amazon thing. Wheel of Time got a similar treatment, ruining the books from the get go. At least with Game of Thrones we had 6-7 magnificent seasons with the showrunners only ruining season 8. Through no fault of their own, i might add, with Geargo R. R. Martin taking an eternity to come up with the final books. These showrunners here have no such excuse, with thousands of pages of lore available.And why are there hobbits in this series AT ALL?Edit: Having seen 2 episodes now, this is already getting quite disturbing. The series so far has almost nothing in common with Tolkiens works. Galadriel swimming back across an entire ocean? The timeline for the second age has already been thrown overboard to accomodate the storylines of the showrunners own inventions, namely, the humans of the south and the totally unnecessary harfoot-hobbits with their fall-from-the-sky-stranger. Dont tell me that is Earendil resurrected, or, even worse, Gandalf. Snot-nosed Elrond is suddenly in the center of ring-creating and in a stone smashing contest with Durin? BTW, the dwarves of Khazad-Dum look totally ridiculous. And where is Elros? Supposedly this series is about the second age, Akallabêth, part 4 of the Silmarillion. The rise and fall of Numenor with Elros, Elronds twin brother, as its first King. So where is he?I could go on and on about everything that is wrong but i guess we will have to wait and see. The writers might surprise us in a positive way yet, but i am not very hopeful.",BillClinton48,6,0.5,Yes,Adrift,1,2
Stranger Things,"The first episode was a coming-of-age survival tale set in Middle-Earth and now weve gone full-blown STRANGER THINGS where this shows version of Frodo and Sam (two girls) discover The Stranger, a bearded man version of 11 who, like David Bowie before him, fell to Earth, providing the most grounded of Fantasy franchises a dash of science-fiction...Which isnt as bad as some of these pre-Hobbits dialogue, one actually saying, Your moms gonna kill you... What is this, The Bradyfoot Bunch?Other stories borrow from either Waterworld where the younger version of JRR Tokeins forever young Elf Girl is basically a fight-loving Xena, and she meets a guy as, to use modern verbage... as HOT as she is, providing some of that soapy element common in just about any serial no matter the genre...These two beauties actually do have chemistry and it doesnt feel forced, unlike the comic relief of a bawdy Dwarf who belches with pride and seems more of the cornball-cocky likes of Peter Jacksons The Hobbit films as opposed to his LOTR...And his wife, ugh, is like someone from a bad situation comedy: The Honeymooners meets Martin... Really bad... Meanwhile Elrond, doing business with said dwarf, remains cool as a cucumber, doesnt have a lot going as hes super important being Elrond... but he looks the part okay...Then theres The Walking Dead horror element in the third story about a Middle-Earth-hillbilly human village thats sort of wisely guarded by a Fantasy Kung Fu type wanderer, who happens to be black and hes elf, having an affair with the ligh skinned woman and, get this, their relationship is frowned-upon by local racists...Herein its because shes human and hes an Elf but really, this is one of several modern day sensibilities plunged into a world that should not resemble ours at all... And yet, not ALL of it does, which is a relief because while not perfect this could have been a lot worse....The makers keep things basically basic, and have that all-important cliffhanger device down, the most important element in what turns a streaming series into a binging-series but... whether its worth binging on... time will tell...",TheFearmakers,6,0.5,No,Adrift,3,6
"Better than the first episode, but still missing something","Adrift is a better episode than the choppy first, it is paced better, acted a little better and sets up the story going forwards. Like episode one, Nori is still the highlight so far, and I though the scenes with Elrond and Durin were pretty funny and well done. The scenes in Khazad-dûm were the best part of this episode, and they very much felt like they belonged in the Hobbit Trilogy. The sets and quality of the visuals during these scenes were fantastic, so props to the guys responsible for carrying these few episodes.That being said, Galadriel is still boring, as is the elf warrior guy - Arondir and his weird relationship with Bronwyn.We got an opening title, with was ok, but getting to hear Howard Shore do some more LotR music was a joy, and its glad to see he hasnt lost his touch. The rest of the music, done by Bear McCreary is also very good, but this should be expected by the guy who composed the music to a much better Amazon show, The Outlander and the video game God of War.Adrift was just fine, not great, not bad. I do hope the episodes get better going forwards, but I think Amazon should have released 3 episodes instead of 2, because Im still not invested in these characters or the story.",Dannyboi94,6,0.5685279187817259,No,Adrift,112,197
"Watchable, tolkien adjacent fantasy","This second episode of the series confirms without shadow of a doubt that this is a high budget, well-made fantasy tale.The story writing veers however towards the level of big budget fanfiction based on the appendices and poetry of LOTR.The timelines compared to Tolkiens work seem highly compressed, which makes sense given the need for a TV show to have greater character coherence than a multi (human) generations long saga.The Harfoots provide a tolerable comedy element to what would otherwise be a mess of po-faced Elvish melancholy. The Irish tinker trope has however been done to death in fantasy and I do wish the writers had been a little more creative in mixing things up a bit .The broad farce of the Dwarvish kingdom was leaven slightly by hints of intrigue (though we all know how the story of Khaza-Dum ends). We already know that Dwarves like Riches, Beer and Family and that they are a proud and prickly people so none of the events here are out of character.The corruption of the southlands and the withdrawal of the Elven order guards, with its promise of a forbidden love story should be capable of sustaining some strong resonances with real world Western powers actions in foreign lands. But the easy rules of good and evil in Fantasy will probably get in the way of a more subtle geopolitical commentary.The story of Elrond and Celebrimbor is still to play out but it will surely form the crux of the tale as they create the eleven rings and trigger the doom of the 2nd Age.Galadriels story is (thus far) the least satisfying. Despite her age she has not yet achieved the grace of the Lady of Lorien and indeed, the Galadriel of Tolkiens works was not a warrior, but a melancholy pacifist who didnt take up arms against Morgoth believing him to be undefeatable. It makes it hard to see how she could get from where she is to where she ends up. The most ludicrous plot point so far is the idea that someone as wise as Galadriel is supposed to be would jump off a ship off the coast of Elven Florida expecting to swim the equivalent of the Atlantic back to Europe. Perhaps this will be where Numenor appears in the story.Overall it remains watchable. I just have to stop trying to fit it in with Tolkiens wider world-history and think of it as an entirely new fantasy that just borrows some names and locations.",johndavidson-1,6,0.7727272727272727,Yes,Adrift,17,22
A flawed improvement - Good aspects,"BEWARE: SPOILERS AND THEORIESThe bonding between Gandalf and the proto-hobbits is sort of fun in a way, it adds some fluff as to why he likes them so much. The wizard presence and the fact we know the role theyll come to play makes it feel worthwhile to focus in these scenes; but the truth is that the harfoots feel very out of place. Its like theyre taken from a kids show, and perhaps having a few get eaten by wargs would have been a good thing to have their exposed and vulnerable existance emphased. Moving on.Galadriel and the Numenórians continue to be the primary source of facepalm in this series, and honestly brings it down the most for me. Galadriel is still acting like an emotional 19-year old with an attitude, whose vengeful and snarky behavior does not radiate millennia of wisdom and grace. The numenórians, I suppose, are some kind of human superpower in the world, but despite this behave in a tribal and erratic way. They invade a continent with three ships and some horsemen..? Where are the legions? Where is the naval supremacy? It is nowhere to be found.As a general note; For all the CGI grandness this series has, it is absolutely absent in portraying the scale of armies and buzz of life. This I find to be quite reoccurring in the series; vast and impressive sceneries with an awkward lack of flesh. This makes me feel like all Halbrand actually is aspiring to be king over is two villages; one was massacred in the early episodes and the other is full of dimwits.The battle has so many flaws that it is the singular event that stops me from rating the episode higher. Why leave the fortified tower? Why fight in the village? How do you not tell youre fighting humans instead of orcs? How did the numenórians know where to find them? The only reason the elf is alive is because the big orc fella thought it was a good time to goof around.What redeems this episode, and largely a big part of the series for me, is Sauron. He is scheming, he is behaving in a sensible way, exploiting the rampant dimwittedness of his enemies. The actor does the role well, and though many thought otherwise I actually enjoyed the birth of Mordor very much. The dilemma it puts me in is that I now find myself rooting for Sauron. I cant wait for him to get taken to Numenór next episode and start wreaking havoc on the naive and daft locals. When their island sinks, itll be like a strange kind of darwinian justice that everyone saw coming.",andrekilden,6,0.0,Yes,Udûn,0,1

"An in-depth episode review. Summary: Very slow and stale. The stunning visuals cant hide the mediocre writing behind the dialogue, characterisation and plot.","Arondirs waking up scene had some good editing and filmmaking, something rare for the show. The realization that not only one but the two other woodland elves partners of him were also captured raises a lot of intrigue and questions that I hope are answered. The show is just slow in so many ways and so incoherent in its writing in most parts of it so no matter how good a concept they have in their hands they butcher it.Galadriels waking up scene seemed to show a promising start for the writing in the episode, but I was wrong. The presentation of the mysterious ship and his captain was a bit stale due to the stiff almost robotic acting. It reminded me of an exchange that would happen in Phantom Menace with decent writing but a delivery devoid of emotion. Nevertheless, the presentation of Numenor: a site to behold. As per usual, the production value of the show in terms of presentation is impeccable. Although its sort of what youd expect from the most expensive show ever made...We are greeted with a heavy exposition scene that I hope doesnt become a norm in the show. The reception by the regent Queen has wittier dialogue than expected yet the lack of backstory to why elves and Numenorians are not in good terms deflates the stakes and reduces it to a mere matter of race? I mean, if we dont know what drift their friendship apart then how are we to understand this animosity between Galadriel and the Queen. Also, this scene ends quite incoherently, when Halbrand hugs the Captain and leaves with Galadriel, we are later shown he has retrieved her dagger. However, in the sequence right after the hug, his left side can be seen and we see NO DAGGER, yet when the scene cuts to the next scene hes holding a dagger which he then gives galadriel. I wouldnt nitpick as much if the layout of these scenes werent so poorly executed: a supposed prisoner with no robes in which to hide a dagger the size of his forearm is able to walk away in the middle of a circling crowd with noone noticing? They are literaly standing in the center of the room and all eyes are on them. I knew what they were going for, i knew this act by Halbrand was supposed to come across as an attempt to strengthen their friendship but its so poorly executed that it fails. Also their dialogue is atrociously writen, mentions of people dying go over Halbrands head saying he wants peace and wants to stay yet he relates to Galadriels quest to save those people? We cant figure out what sort of man Halbrand is like this.The end of the scene leads to a supposed epic narration including slow-mo walking from Elendil to describe who he is and introduce his son in a thrilling ship sailing sequence. Now, I reviewed this on my second watching and so I knew who this kid was because you learn who he is later on; however, if you watch it the first time and you dont know your LOTR lore, like, who Elendils son is, then this seemingly epic transition to introduce a new supposedly relevant character doesnt feel earned because they dont even mention his name... If they had, maybe non-LOTR fans would have a familiarity with the name Isildur. Also, his name is uttered for the first real time by a fellow sailor. This is Isildur we are talking about, he wholl lead the armies of middle earth to war with Sauron and wholl defeat Sauron and refuse to destroy the One ring... He is called from the boat by a nobody really and without buildup whatsoever. Again, this could be nitpicking or a personal preference of mine where I prefer they try to build up the epicness of moments and names and places as thats what Tolkiens world does for me, but what do I know.Then we get to meet his non-canon made up sister showing up and basically having no reaction to a supposed comedy exchange where Isildur greets the horse she brought with her rather than his own sister... Seriously, the lack of reactions to ANYTHING at all is baffling to me. And another brilliant exchange happens full of great writing:
Come see us later (to the cantine). Dont be like your brother, you got your whole life to be an old maid
Or to be young
... No you dont, thats the whole purpose. You are only young once, you are only supposed to be allowed to be immature and reckless when you are young and thats frowned upon when you get older... This supposed savvy comment doesnt land because it makes no sense. Its intent is to highlight the fact that she should have more fun and not be so boring and yet this is conveyed using the wrong concepts. I dont know, it still gets the message across but its so convoluted for no reason.More weirdly worded dialogue ensues with Elendil and the regent Queen who, after he said he did what he thought most prudent, said that if thats really his wish (which it isnt, he just stated why he did what he did) that then he should take on a task for her. Now, again, after I rewatched the episode to review it, I found out that, unless Im mistaken, he was given a mysterious task after being given a sword, leading us to believe he were to kill Galadriel? Yet, at the end of this episode he actually helps her out, so if there is in fact an undisclosed task he must carry on, either he is waiting to kill her later on (which would be so very stupid and it doesnt actually happen) or his mission is actually not killing her, in which case I really hope they have a reason to put so much emphasis on giving him a sword (maybe the sword is special or something)So the orcs are building a passage through Middle Earth. A passage for which they are cutting down trees and putting up tents because they dont like the sun... I thought a tunnel would be more comfortable for them but I guess they might need to carry tall structures like catapults and trolls so it might not be the best idea. But then why cut down the trees that could provide them with shadow? Idk, this whole passage business doesnt seem like a smart idea. But maybe I missed something. Either way, the fatal papercut Arondirs friend gets apparently kills him quite fast, either the orc was REALLY precise in cutting the right artery to almost instantly kill him or the show was too afraid of decapitations. Which, seeing how it really got out of its way to portray this proto-orcs as a close cousin from Peter Jacksons take (saying things like cut down this stinking tree and intonating the same way they did), was a recurring thing orcs did and they seemed more ruthless because of it. Anyways, this scene is kind of interesting because it makes sense that for woodland elves, trees and the forest are sacred things they devote their lives in protecting so seeing this conflict of the proto-orcs making their way, cutting down nature as they represent industry is quite fitting and interesting. More of Tolkiens themes shine through the canopy.Galadriels antagonistic personality finally fits in her circumstances as she is in actual enemy grounds. That scene where Elendil is tasked with something by the Queen and his later assistance in Galadriels escape builds a distrusting mystery that could be interesting. However, the galloping through the lands is hilariously goofy with that slow motion sequence. What were they thinking? This super speddown slowmotion only makes sense in two circumstances: either it has been presented sooner that Galadriel LOVES, absolutely adores, riding horses, horses in general or simply traveling/galloping; OR there is an epic, almost magical, scene happening and slow mo elevates the epicness. This scene is neither, because the slow-mo is used to convey joy and relish that beautiful moment in that breathtaking landscape but we are not emotionally invested. It feels like watching a shampoo ad campaign. And its all because, again, we dont know how Galadriel is like, we dont know her. The only things we know is that she is on a quest of vengeance, she is a fierce warrior and she doesnt like and distrusts EVERYBODY.The Hall of Lore looks nice though small. Why is the camera so close to the ground? Wherere our establishing shots? This is what I mean when I say the show presents settings that sound marvelous and epic and yet theres no establishing shots when they are first presented. We only saw the establishing shot of the city earlier in the horse ride but not that of the library. And if its true Numenor is inspired in Mediterranean cultures, they should know libraries were some of the most architecturally predominant buildings, next to churches and palaces. Anyway, this is but a mere nitpick piling on the previous one so nothing really new, whats new is the amount of development we finally have on this turtle of a plot: we finally know the meaning of Saurons brand... Its a map. When the brand was shown to us on several occasions it was only shown vertically. And it turns out if you rotate it, it turns into a map? It just feels like we werent visually led to believe there were other interpretations to the brand nor the mere fact it warranted meaning. We just assumed it was Saurons brand and thats all. But with this information some phrases spoken earlier in the show make more sense now, like in episode 1 when Galadriel said that this brand was for orcs to follow... Its still a bit tacked on but the plan is interesting and we know where it leads because we have seen LOTR.All the hobbits are gathering their stuff and getting ready to leave. To which they feel they have to: make a pagan-like dance, with costumes and such? This is never explained nor is it mentioned ever again. And Jesus, the bickering of Nori and the other girl is so tiring, have them either agree to help her or to finally tell on her but stop with this constant arguing. Is like everything in this show is stretched out to fill up the runtime. Everything happens so slowly and it takes so much time for everything to develop that it seems they are trying to make too many seasons for such a short story they wanna tell.",quiqueperezsoler,6,0.3684210526315789,Yes,Adar,7,19
"Despite the Hype, a Deceptive Series So Far","The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is, so far, a deceptive TV series, despite the hype.

But its only problem is that it neglects its potential to be amazing. The third episode suffered from some undeniable weaknesses, especially in terms of storytelling. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that it has several undeniable positive points. In the coming episodes, well see what storytelling looks like in the long run. Will the negative points fade or will the strong points be less visible?There is a moment in episode 3 of season 1 that reminds the viewer that while sometimes going their own way in the story, the creators of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power did not limit their attention to the valuable adaptation source to things like great visual details. . which moment The moment that shows Arundirs grief when he is forced to cut a tree to prevent the death of other people.

She has no other personality traits other than find sauron. How? How can a character who has lived through much seen so much and done so much be this 1 dimensional? I understand you want to do character development through the series and by the end of the show she should be more in line with the LOTR version, but that doesnt mean you have to simplify the character at the start to nothing more than a moody teenager.

As evidenced several times in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, even immortal Elves can be killed, so the idea of Galadriel living after standing exposed and face front to an horrific volcanic explosion is beyond ludicrous!Its a shame that Amazon has to resort to extreme over-the-top tactics to make this series dramatic and exciting.

"Exciting action, beautifully shot, but...","This episode contains some great action and beautiful shots, and the amount of time and skill it took to train for and shoot the horse scenes is obvious to anyone. And the final scene is mesmerizing, particularly as you consider the future of Middle-Earth. However, the scene between Galadriel and Adar strikes absolutely the wrong note, and it does make me worried for the future of this series if the writing can get it SO wrong for such important scenes.Yes, we know Galadriel is tormented by the guilt of her brothers death; and yes, we know she has been hunting the shadow of Sauron for a VERY. LONG. TIME. And yes, we know she hasnt exactly been treated well by the rest of her people, who havent sought to understand her at all, but rather sharpened her into an arrow and pointed her at something. What did they expect would happen to her? Unfortunately the writers of Rings of Power think that means she should be a stubborn bully that sucks all the joy of the room. But as if that werent enough, in the scene 1:1 scene with her and Adar, she responds to his mention of a place for his people to call home with a genocidal rant. Im not naive enough to think Adar is good or that his intentions are truly about all of his children, but Galadriels response is such an unnecessary escalation it almost amounts to a war crime. And it does nothing to build any sympathy or good feeling for her character.It took me out of the scene, and it took me out of the episode, and it got me thinking about the future of the show. I know I was supposed to be shocked and afraid for Galadriel at the very end, but quite frankly I couldnt bring myself to care.

A couple of nice scenes but not epic,"For my subjective taste this episode misses the epic feeling I got when watching original LOTR.

The village is tiny! Where is the money intended for this series, I dont understand. It feels more like Xena or Hercules TV series and not an epic show to be remembered.I remember the Gandalf scene of the original movie where he rides over a hill with an army of thousands riders into huge army of orcs with pikes. That felt epic and truly unique for its time. And that was more than 15 years ago where the CGI was not even close to what we have today.",nmihin,6,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,1,3
This show needs help ASAP!,"Where to start with the actors who are far too good for the show and carry every scene theyre in or the actors who shouldnt have ever been cast, some of the performances are so wooden and unemotional its painful to watch. Some of the logic as well is midn blowing the trip the harfoots take seems to takes weeks but then cuts back to galadriel whos done a million different things and crossed the sea in a matter of days? The survivors in the Southlands get out the tower and back to village where the orcs were camped without any of the orcs noticing them leaving the tower and walking past them. Its mind blowing how poor this show is.",danpearce-55075,6,0.0,Yes,Udûn,0,1
Way Better than i expected it to be,"Ok, after watching Wheel Of Time, i thought this show would be downright horrible but I stand corrected for now. 6.6/10The Pros:
-The landscapes are just mind blowing, the cgi work might be the best I have ever seen in any show ever.-The story is interesting enough to watch more episodes. The climax of the episode was a cherry on top and solidified the hook.The Cons:
-The characters all seem so bland and generic, with none of the acting performances up to the mark, like its just meh.-The forced inclusion, cause the loosing of immersion. Like every remote village need not have people from all over the world, like thats so un-realistic and illogical.-Surely the episode could have been trimmed down to around 45 minutes.-Galadriels fighting sequence was really cringy, she doesnt seem to have the speed nor strength for it.-The dialogues did not feel innovative although I appreciate that they communicated in an older style of English.",gokulmadhu-37537,6,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,1
Half part great half part average,"Episode 4 of Rings of Power is actually pretty great, for the most part. Like previous episodes, the dialogue and acting is very average and the story is muddled and confused. We are now 4 episodes in - 4 hours of screentime and yet the story is still barely progressing, I feel like at times Im watching something pointless.That being said, there is a lot to like in this episode, for one - the music. Bear has composed a great soundtrack for the series as a whole, but it isnt more present than it is here. There are truly some fantastic themes throughout this episode. The visuals are amazing, as usual but the standout has to be the story within Khazad-dûm. Elrond and Durin have a very good on screen friendship and both actors play well off each other. Disa is also entertaining, even though I havent been fond of the actress during the marketing of the series. Every scene that takes place within Khazad-dûm was great and I would rather see an hour of just that than everything else that took place elsewhere in the story.Like the past 3 episodes the characters are still what drag this down. Despite me being able to look past all the lore breaking nonesense the series has been doing so far. The Arondir and Bronwyn relationship is still as bland as it was in episode 2, Galadriel is still a grumpy college student. The problem with this show is that they are trying to balance too many characters at once. They have invented all these new characters, when they should have been focusing on the central ones, top give us time with them. We have seen them for 4 hours now, and only 3 are even remotely interesting.I will keep up hope that the series will get better, despite this being a pretty solid episode. Maybe in the future of this series does get a season 2, they will vastly improve on everything that has made season 1 poor.6.5/10.",Dannyboi94,6,0.6647058823529411,No,The Great Wave,113,170
Not the worst.,"This is not the worst attempt at a prequel. Characters are different from the books but adequate for this TV version of the stories from Tolkein. There are some funny moments. Elrond with hair? (Of course that is from the movies.)As The Guardian commented in its review the accents are deplorable. All the Elves have BBC English and the Hobbits have escaped from some 1950s Irish musical. Oh Begorah! And as for Men. A bit of Mockney and there is not a doubt theyre baduns.The first episode is entertaining enough. Although I thought the Elves could have been better fighters. Galadriel repeatedly did the kung-fu posing of delivering a blow and turning her back as the target collapses behind her.The effects and scenery were very well done. Although not mentioned in the books, I could believe in Elven watchtowers on the models of Roman borders. All in all, I wont give up yet.",bobetjo,6,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,2
Dissapointing,"So the Ive seen the first episode, and this is my take so far. So the series is very, very high production value - saying anything else is bs. But so far the story/plot is what makes this weak. The use of tropes that you have seen before is just to much.. The warrior that is told to stop because of peace time but the enemy is still there, the girl who wants more than a quiet life, the forbidden love, all are presented in a way that seems dull and boring. I mean unless you like you entertainment to be easily understood and minimize your risk of failing. And that is my final point, this show has the very clear feel of a production that is afraid of taking chances, but god if they grow a pair season two might actually be good! Ill update this when the whole season is out. Just my opinion.",pa-stypinsky,6,0.3333333333333333,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,1,3
An in-depth episode review. Summary: A visually stunning start with a commanding presence but a weak writing and some weak characterization,"Before reviewing the episode, I watched both the episodes for a better grasp on the tone, path and overall vibe of the show itself. Granted only two episodes out of 8 (I think) are out but I feel 2 hours of runtime is enough to judge those things clearly overall. Knowing that here we go:The flashback scene is well filmed and cinematic. The musical crescendos help elevate the presentation of the show overall. However these are soured by a bullying scene that feels a bit cliche and a conversation that tries to be foreshadowing and metaphoric but it feels incoherent and convoluted for some reason.I personally like the narration and the back story of the show. Its very simple and epic in scale, it resembles a lot of Peter Jackson. It would have been nice if we got to see the war but I guess we might see the next one, maybe.It is at the icy cave that we begin to see a first sign of trouble. And I tried not to nitpick and wait to see the story unfold, but it seems like every person Galadriel speaks to is against whatever she is doing or saying. Her soldiers are all wimpy and whiners and it has no thematic purpose at all, we are literally watching a band of elves go out on this difficult journey and they are complaining like children. All except one, she who can defeat a Troll by herself with no ones help, she who can climb, fight, investigate, and argue like no other. Our main character has no turmoil externally nor an internal want or need other than to serve vengeance for her brother. Now there are attempts at making her be too obsessed with her revenge that she puts someones life in danger, but narratively it serves no other purpose than to show how hard the weather conditions are and therefore transit to the next scene. But other than that, nothing to do with Galadriel. She doesnt care, that consequence doesnt affect her or we get to see her reflect on her actions at all.To be fair, the reveal of their destination through the storm and the score swelling was quite great and the cave eerily introduced and presented. However, Galadriel must have been there before because she seems to know everything about it and none of the other travelers do. Like what must have happened, where to go, where the secret door is. Now, if it had been established earlier that she was older or had lived more experiences or gone on more journeys you could attribute this to her knowledge acquired through her age, and this kind of works with the one whiny man who complains unceasingly. He looks considerably younger, but you never know how life-experienced an Elf character is because they live for centuries and they age slowly. And thats their whole demeanor, Elves are a pure, tall and wise race because they have lived a lot. Yet these Elves... They must have just come out of high school because they state the obvious quite a bit. Idk, i guess its hard to see Elves as these whiny wimpy and uncunning characters. And its hard to really judge them because we know nothing about them, nor Galadriel. We dont know what shes been doing all this years and how this endless search has affected her. We know nothing about her as a person! She is a mere plot device to push the story forward.And whats with the brand signifying the orcs went north?! How does she know that!? She wasnt there! And she associates it with the brand left on her brother right after she said it was meant for orcs to follow... That makes no sense. And also she is the one that misses home more than anyone. Why? Why would she miss it more, other Elves have lost people too in the war, you are not the only one in the world! Galadriel is unrecognizable and theres no trace of her commanding yet peaceful presence and demeanor here, even if she were portrayed as younger and less experienced. Also, it doesnt help that the actress has one face for every emotion, I get Elves are supposed to be a bit colder in expression but it is very noticeable that the other characters are more alive than her because they react to things with a wider range of emotions.Next, we are introduced to the equivalent of Hobbits and Sam and Frodo of this show. The camping montage is fun and well realized, I like this new race of hobbit and the berry scene. Again, the CGI in everything is incredibly well-realized and captures whatever is not possible to achieve in reality. Yet in some aspects, particularly the instances when the real interacts closely with the unreal when its fakeness is made most apparent. Specifically when the backdrop of a scene is entirely fake, like in the following scene with the introduction of Elrond. But theres no denying the staging, costume design and presentation of the scenes is impeccable and something I truly love about the show. Like in the next scene with Galadriels dress, her long hair, Elronds robes and entrance, the lighting of the room, the beautiful tapestry. Then, again, the mood drops when the characters start talking. They speak in this high voice and eloquent dialogue with complicated phrasing to make you think they are highly versed intelligent people when really they are expressing themselves in the most banal way.The constant hostility Galadriel brings to every character exchange is tiring to watch as it gives no insight to why she thinks or does the things she says. She is endlessly defiant and we never know why she has a grudge with everyone. I understand she is supposed to be driven in her quest to avenge her brother but this obsession isnt presented as a character flaw she must overcome nor is it ever questioned by others. Perhaps this could be the reason of her grudge with them, I guess well have to wait and see. But we dont know why Galadriel is so antagonistic with every elf in the world, or why she cares so little about the damage she is causing others. And in all this, we still dont know anything about her as a person, we know only her goal. So I personally cant relate to her as a character let alone our main character. I think she is unlikable and cant really judge her as a person because she has no agency of her own.Even Nori, the Frodo of our story, is better fleshed out as a character than Galadriel. I am invested in her story because we know what motivates her, what she is like, and why she acts the way she acts. Galadriel is the definition of a snowflake personality: unable to accept criticism, to empathize or sympathize with noone; and this would only be acceptable if this was presented as a character flaw she must overcome but it unfortunately isnt. We are supposed to follow this character who acts more like a villain, naive to the destruction she causes others, self-centered in her own world and unable to interact with others without her having the higher ground or the last say. Talking down to Elrond, assuming he hasnt seen evil the way she has.Elrond: Put out your sword
Galadriel: Without it what would I be?
Elrond: What you have always been: My friendThis is the writing of this show. So Elrond, would Galadriel not be your friend if she were to bear arms? The exchange between the two kids in the Sword stealing scene is a great example of how the writing here is exactly the same kind of writing as with the adult characters but with the fundamental difference that this kind works better with children as they are impulsive and emotional, something adults character technically shouldnt be in most circumstances. Ill wait and see the rest of the season to judge the writing though but so far is a bit weak.The presentation of Arondir and the woodland elves in the town is really well executed. With subtle social commentaries during the tense scene shared by the single woodland elf character that is portrayed by an african american with a group of mostly white people. In these circumstances, the higher moral ground is achieved not by physically or verbally reacting to a wrong behavior or opinion but rather by acknowledging the obvious moral superiority the character surely has. Where other writers would have had him give a speech or try to educate the intolerant people present with lessons we already know are wrong because any decent human being knows how wrong it is, the show think of us smarter and therefore sets the seeds of the status quo in the town in a brief and subtle way. And I love that kind of writing, being able to establish a complex situation with the least amount of scenes and exchanges is top tier entertainment because it lends to more runtime to tell more story, it allows us to gather more of the fruit those planted seeds create. And this guy is not only well fleshed out in his way of thinking and viewing people, but he is also established as a badass in that scene. He is officially my first favorite male character of the show.CONCLUSION:
All things considered (the good and the bad), this first episode was pretty good. It takes its time to slow down and recreate itself in the presentation of things (characters, settings, concepts) without messing up the pacing too much. And I feel that is a very important aspect of Tolkiens work. His world is so thoroughly realized that not taking the time to relish it and pan around in the moment to it being represented would defeat one of the fundamental aspects of any world-building. However, it is dragged down by weak writing and unlikable characters. Several story threads are presented and yet I feel invested in only half of them, which for a show based in such a rich source material (although not so rich in what specifically it is adapting though) and with such a budget literally personifies the expressions leaves much to be desired and Not up to par.",quiqueperezsoler,6,0.5,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,1,2
Build,"Usually the first episode to any show is building for the season but has a good hook throughout. I think this fell a little flat, in an hour I got one elf wants to fight, a ( hobbit I think ) wants to explore past her home and a rouge elf is basically looking for a wait take part in.This episode, if it was a new series and not linked to LOTR Id probably give up, but I keep the faith and will go on.On the positive side, its absolutely breath taking to look at, the score is really good too. I did like some of the characters but I just fell there is no umph to get them going yet.The ending of course leaves us with a bit of a cliff hanger and yes it has my attention but even as cliff hangers go, it was a little bit meh.",eoinpgeary,6,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,2
Overlay of constant music doesnt fix it :(,"Like most of us Im sure, I was greatly looking forward to the continuation of this epic saga.My skepticism started as I watched the trailers when so much focus was on the revealed head shots like pulling down their hoods and looking right into the camera....that were so staged.... I started to have my doubts about the depth and focus we would be getting with this version.Sadly, my suspicions were right. The depth just isnt there...I really hope the director makes changes to next season (&amp; if any way to make changes to this one that would be amazing).My biggest complaint is the overlay of music, albeit beautiful orchestra playing, it is constantly playing too loud as an overlay so you can barely hear what the actors are saying but, worse, it takes away from the environment and feel of the scenes and diminishes their value. Its too much, too loud in the mix And way too often.It seems like the director is using the music to fill in the drama that just isnt there.The dialogue is also misplaced. There are long rants of shakespearian speak that is unnecessary and due to the overlay of music, you cant make out anyway.While there is potential for depth and umph Im doubtful it will be explored, at least this season.Both my husband and I almost fell asleep :(. Which breaks my heart.The director needs to spend quality time alone with Peter Jacksons versions and learn.",cmatzenauer,6,0.4,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,5
Immersion-proof,"The pilot felt uninspired and mediocre at best.If there ever was meant to be any immersion, it was destroyed by acting and overall little to no characterizations. The characters are shallow and mostly either completely hateful or slightly aggressive toward everything. So its hard to find someone to root for, maybe except the harfoots.The uninspired acting is solidified by random dialogue ranging from actually good to painful.The pilot had strong production value but a rather weak art counterpart, with the best thing being a couple of memorable music tracks. The Arondir theme was amazing, pretty much helped me to get through his boring scenes.Overall, Id say my initial impression was spoiled by the amazing work of Peter Jackson and his art crew.This one just feels not different, but soulless in comparison.",kuarinofu,6,0.4,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,5
NO JOY,"Unlike TLOTR, you dont get hooked or excited about anything. Everything just seems so forced and the way they are trying to make you root for characters is so forced that you end up not caring at all for them or what they have to say. They spent so much time making stuff up about the world and the things that might have happened according to the writers and they forgot to spend effort on the most important thing in tolkiens works: compelling characters. So empty and dull that it feels like their only purpose is to take these characters from one pretty scenery to the next to just talk about uninteresting stuff (or maybe its the delivery that makes it uninteresting). I dont want to blame the cast because they are only working with what they are given but I just dont care enough for any of them. Hopefully as the story progresses things will get more interesting but if I were asked if I want to keep watching the show I wouldnt. Episode 1 is it for me.",marjavier,6,0.3333333333333333,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,3,9
Amateur hour is upon us,"4th episode in we are treated to some serious bad writing and even worse execution of the bad writing.This episode really made me wonder if the writers even read any Tolkien at all. I could be wrong but I feel at the end Amazon is going to regret not getting Peter Jackson involved.On the plus side the orcs look pretty cool and the cinematography is more than adequate. CGI looks above average as well. But the script is weak and drags on. There are also more useless, annoying characters introduced in this episode and dull filler material. Yes, only 4 episodes in and already we have an episode comprised of filler material.Still going to keep watching.",tenseicoalition,6,0.6444444444444445,No,The Great Wave,29,45
Mixed bag but showing promise,"Whilst it was enjoyable to see Numenor, this storyline feels slow and laborious, with the scenes of Isildor feeling like they were more bothered about name dropping than anything of substance. Although this part of this episode underwhelmed me, I do think this storyline is the one with most potential, and Im very excited to watch it play out.The Harfoot storyline is dull, I feel no affinity to any of the characters or the plot that they will ultimately be pushing along. I dont think Id have such issue if there wasnt such screen time taken up. If they had been given no screen time and you now saw them migrating with some stranger, then I dont think anything would be different. Waste of screen time.For me the Arondir portion of this episode was great (minus the killing off of unimportant characters trying to evoke emotion from the watcher). It provided actual world building and gives a better picture of what is going on in the Southlands.Overall I think the episode was a step in the right direction. Hopefully as the world develops, we will spend more time with the more significant and interesting storylines.Lord of the Rings was plot heavy, and the main difference I see with that and Rings of Power is that it feels aimless. Were 3 episodes in and I still feel like its lacking in overall direction.What has happened so far could easily be condensed into 1 episode, and Im sure the watcher would still have the same affinity with the characters.",thomasbuckle-11964,6,0.4642857142857143,No,Adar,26,56
Is it good or bad? I dont know yet but I think its at least better than the previous,"I think this episodes has some improvement from the last two. Keeping the episode focused on only three different stories is much nicer than the back and forth of 4-6 stories in the last two episodes. So far in the series I havent really been interested in any of the characters or story lines however the Númenóreans has so far been the most interesting setting and characters so far and this episode managed to make me more interested in Arondir. The Halfoots were much of the same, I didnt really care for it but it you liked them in the first two episodes youll probably like them here. On episode 3 and its still feels like theres a lot to set up, and Im nervous the whole season will end up feeling like set up however it does seem to start to get its footing.The introduction to Númenór as it was slowly revealed was great.The writing and dialogue is a still not anything great however my issues seemed reduced in this episode and contains a couple stronger written scenes. The action and cgi wasnt great in its direction and I really hope theyll change the style of action in the future.If you liked the first two episodes I think youll like this one even more though if your like me with some criticism and skepticism I think this episode is at least an improvement from the last.",noahlietzau,6,0.4852941176470588,No,Adar,33,68
"The best episode so far, but still missing something","Episode 3 of Rings of Power is a vast improvement over the previous episodes. I know the bar for that is pretty low, but ep3:Adar is actually pretty decent. Its not amazing, there are plenty of problems here like the usual bad dialogue the average acting and poorly paced story - of which is finally progressing. In the first episode and we are finally moving forwards with the plot, that is a major issue.The characters are all still stiff and only few of them stand out. Halbrand is the stand out here, he plays a street smart rogue and the actor does a pretty good job. Everyone else.... not so much. Galadriel is still dull main character as is Arondir. Although the parts with the orcs were good moments. I was glad to see the orcs in full make-up and costume.Im not fully knowledgeable of Tolkiens works, but I know some of it and a lot of the story and characters dont add up, which is my biggest issue with this series as a whole. I know you cant critise the series without being named all sorts of insults, but the Elves are the weakest part about this episode and the series. They just dont work at all. The elves are supposed to be elegant and stunning and should never look old. There are several old looking elves and it is just weird.That aside for the bad, the best thing about this episode were the scenes in Númenor. The visuals and sets built for this place were astounding, even if it didnt make a lot of sense.Ep3 was a better episode but it still isnt great. The story is still poor, the characters bland and is carried mainly by its visuals (apart from that warg, that looked horrific).",Dannyboi94,6,0.631578947368421,No,Adar,144,228
The story is starting to come together,"While the Rings of Power is a very slow show, so slow you begin to grow gray hairs while watching it, it is finally beginning to come together. The southlander and numenor plotlines are converging, the harfoot story is (very painfully) moving along, and we are getting some nice character development of Durin (one of the most enjoyable characters thus far), Halbrand, some of the southlanders (their conflicting motivations), and Definitely-Not-Gandalf.The show continues to be absolutely gorgeous with excellent costuming, amazing shots of basically everything, and a strong musical score complementing powerful visuals.Downsides are Galadriel who continues to be an overly arrogant rage-bot, the painfully slow story, and a continual lack of motivation to care about whats going on.

Galadriel: Warrior Princess,"Not so bad as some are saying, and not as perfect as others are paid to write, this LORD OF THE RINGS is really more of a HUNGER GAMES set in Middle Earth with an assortment of beautiful young men and mostly women battling for their survival...The latter of course, as in females, provide the lion share of heroics, which angers some (woke as its called) but watching a beautiful Elf-girl in her young Xena Warrior mode isnt so awful...Shes searching for and trying to catch and kill Sauron at the ends of the world which is like attempting to have Satan himself get stuck on fly-paper... The whole Good and Evil aspect is a bit too broad...Then the pre-Hobbits having to live in secret and, when the coast is clear of danger their hidden world unfolds like those old gangster movies about bathroom-gin speak-easy joints when the cops leave, and the dinner tables go back to being craps tables...Anyhow both of these Elf and Pre-Hobbit stories are involving enough... to see how the adventures will sustain... which is what a first episode is supposed to do: make the viewer want more...However once they get to the human village story about some kind of poisoned water it all gets pretty dull, and, being the last tale towards the end, petering-out when its supposed to up the ante isnt good...Yet, overall, the infamously pricey effects are good, and it does seem like another world no matter how much they inject modern-day political themes and personalities within such an ancient setting, and doesnt ruin the thing...

Great Wave calms power rings!,"Interesting point in The Great Wave is the presentation and introduction of the character of Adar (Joseph Maule), a dark elf with evil intentions. It only took a few minutes for it to become clear that he is the most interesting character of the series so far. But perhaps his decision to free Arundir (Ismael Cruz Cordova) is a bit difficult to understand. Well, yes, plot-wise Arundhirs presence is essential to the further course of the show, but what drives him to make decisions is a foundation that doesnt make sense.The above makes this episode fun. Finally, there is still interest in the fate of the characters (some more than others). Maybe the highs and lows of this episode are just a small bump on the way to something even bigger. So, now is not the time to lose faith in the series.In conclusion, the fourth installment of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power continues to show tremendous strength in terms of visual identity, but it still has a lot to improve in its scripts, direction, and character portrayal. All in all, The Great Wave is an episode with plenty of light and shade that promises to be the beginning of an ending for the series most introductory installment.

The Great Impact,"After that episode I came to a conclusion: The Lord of the Rings (movies) was breaking through Middle-earth, crossing the Misty Mountains at amazing speed. The wisps of the night mist could be seen stirring as he advanced swiftly and relentlessly. In the opposite direction, on a collision course and equally fast, came the soap opera Days of our Lives. When the two shared the same point in space-time, Middle-earth shook. The Blue Mountains split, Anduin changed its course, and the Great Sea churned in agony. As a result of this confluence the series The Rings of Power emerged, which merged in a single work the wonderful scenarios and costumes of The Lord of the Rings, with the characters and plot of Days of our Lives.",Ricardo-Meneghelli,6,0.5,No,Partings,3,6
Frustrating episode,"I hate myself for saying this, but the episode was... filler. With the exception of Elrond and Durin, nearly no significant story development occurs. For an 8-episode season, I expected more momentum by the end of the 5th episode.The showrunners are building characters for a multi-season show, unfortunately at the expense of this fundamentally important first season. If we look at comparable other series of sprawling casts: Game of Thrones, Lost, Deadwood, and Friday Night Lights managed to balance world-building, and character development while simultaneously progressing the story.Instead of story progression and captivating action we get character development, but I find it to be pretty underwhelming despite the grandiose score and melodramatic acting. Instead of telling us why we need to care about these characters through labored dialog, please show us! We hit a point of diminishing returns in episode 4, and episode 5 results in frustration.Im optimistic for this show. There are interesting characters in interesting situations. I just hope the writers can deliver on the opportunity.",trbothrowaway,6,0.6666666666666666,No,Partings,2,3
Things dont look good,"Itve been 5 episodes till now and the show keeps on disappointing, now dont get me wrong its not a terrible show, but its not good as well, its just watchable. There are some really good characters in terms of performance, dialogues and their part of the story is interesting such as lord Elrond the elve and Durin the dwarf, their relationship is worth watching, with Elrond being the best character in the show . Galadrial on the other hand has a really weird writing her purpose makes zero sense her dialogues are lame and the performance is... I wont say bad i dont know who can play a character with this bad writing in a way that will actually make it bearable. The Hobbits part is fine not great but not bad, we are still half the way through the season so i wont judge the story but things dont look promising.I dont know why they didnt spent a bigger portion of that 1 billion dollars they have been talking about for years on writing, the visual effects can vary from really good to just fine, but nothing outstanding.So yeah the lord of the rings is disappointing till this moment which is episode 5, maybe the next episodes will prove me wrong, but until then iam not happy with it.",omalola-14223,6,1.0,No,Partings,4,4

Best episode so far,"Galadrial is slightly less annoying, Durins anger is tempered and his aggression a little less. The visuals are great, the CGI not so intrusive in this episode and I felt more invested in the characters than previously. It still feels heavy handed in terms of the clunky dialogue and also seems very youthful in comparison to the age old themes of Tolkien. The issues the characters face and often their behaviour as well, still appear to be those of irritating and wayward teens - pouting and rebelling against authority rather than acting with the wisdom that comes with so much experience.

A move back in the wrong direction,"The hope I had after episode 3 has been diminished quite a bit. I sincerely want to like this show, but sadly it is just rather boring. Every scene slogs on and I still lack true interest in anything thats going on. The only thing that keeps me going at this point is seeing how it will eventually set up the events of The Hobbitt and LOTR. But, like the Star Wars prequels, that is just enough to get me to watch and not enough for me to say I truly am engaged with the plot. Were 4 episodes in and I just dont care about anyone. Im in it til the end, dont get me wrong, but had hoped for much more by this point.",jmillerjr-00983,6,0.3333333333333333,No,The Great Wave,2,6
Stop baiting me into thinking something interesting is going to happen,"Ep. 4 is perfectly in line with the others, except the ending suggests something is finally going to happen.It would be easier for me to continue watching if the leads were relatable and the introduction had more stakes.But since the first three showed everyday life, trying to add fluff to salvage lousy dialogue and unlikable characters, you must consciously decide to force yourself to continue watching.Still no immersion, though. But my favorite confused extras looking straight into the camera are in place.What makes this funnier is that there isnt much to review. The characters are being unfolded not through their hardships but their everyday routine. And the story is getting messier each episode, not even in terms of lore inconsistencies which are plenty, but through immersion-breaking reactions. Galadriel is now officially an utterly different character I have no sympathy for, but they are writing the show as I should have. Shes just starting to get annoying with her persistence, which she validates. That said, most plot twists are based on the characters constantly changing their minds. Its as if theyre working under the viewer and creating false expectations for the sake of false expectations, well, and based on their stubbornness, I guess. Imagine them getting into real trouble.Ive watched four episodes and still havent figured out who Im supposed to empathize with and when something will start happening (probably never). But I get baited every time.",kuarinofu,6,0.3076923076923077,No,The Great Wave,4,13
Another disappointing episode,"The Rings of Power is seemingly suffering from poor writing and character development. Although their visuals and CGI are breath taking and their plot idea has potential, I cannot help but to dislike every character. No ones story resonates with me and I do not appreciate the stakes. This is probably related to how predictable each scene has been so far. Id like for something to shock me, get me emotionally invested.I am also distracted by the blatant box ticking Amazon is pushing to really care about the characters. Take Bronwyn for example; the show portrays her as a fearless badass that will charge head first into a hoard of rushing orcs. Wheres the backstory that reflects her bravery? For me shes nothing more than a virtue signal for GIRLPOWER.I was very excited to finally see Sauron, even more so in Elf form -- however, the delivery was really weak. I didnt sense Adars terror, his power; his awesome; he just seemed like another poorly written character with no depth.TL;DR: I dont care about any character. I dont like any character. Im routing for Sauron.",jonnyleage,6,0.4583333333333333,No,The Great Wave,11,24
Entertaining but Lacking In Many Areas,"The cinematics, visuals, and similar elements of this show continue to be fantastic. Its also at a point in the story where its expanding into other realms and cultures (Numenor, Orcs, etc.), so this is also an exciting part of the series.The thing that sticks out and, in my opinion, is lacking is the writing and storytelling. Theres a lot of (for lack of a better word) lazy dialogue thats added to explain the deeper lore or character history. For example, Muriel asking Pharazon who the captain (Elendil) is not only doesnt make sense for the greater lore, but I think its also a device the writers use to quickly tell the audience who the character is. Theres a similar moment when Halbrand doesnt seem to know what Numenor is so Galadriel just tells him the quick backstory. Just my opinion but this feels like lazy world-building. Strangely enough, mainly because shes such an important character to both the show and in Tolkiens universe, Galadriels storyline is the only storyline that Ive completely lost interest in. I do like Morfydd Clark and think shes doing as good a job as she can, but Im just not interested in Galadriels storyline.Overall, I did enjoy the episode and think there are some interesting storylines developing, but I think it fell short

9/10 CGI + 3/10 screenwriting = Average TV Series,"So let me say that the CGI is very good, at least for the Númenor and Khazad-dum part. Costumes are also excellent. But you can see that most of the money is spent to CGI+other supportive equipments but not screenwriting.1) There is a time-lapse scene for the Elrond-Durin part, but the screenwriting is so terrible, most of the viewers will get confused. You have to tell the story way more better than this.2) You literally left the village couple days ago. Dude, you really didnt take any food with you, Jesus. Such a bad writing!3) I wont mention Galadriels part again, she looks like an immature human, not one of the greatest elves alive.There are other bad parts, but I wont take my time to mention them. You do not have to respect original LOTR lore, you can always write something new, if you are talented enough! This show reminds me the last season of Game of Thrones, where screenwriting was terrible since there was no book to look at!",yetkinpulcu,6,0.2857142857142857,No,The Great Wave,2,7
We are building the second age,"So much of the story is still being laid down for this series. We have one of the most beautiful TV shows but it just hasnt got that feel from the original movies, the grit and dirt has been completely taken from the story. So just hasnt got the same feel.The first time that Numenor is shown on screen and that is a major point for any of the stories that are from the world of Tolkien. The characterization of Isildur hes very young in this series but how many years is this before the battle for middle earth at the end of the second age? Hes meant to be a king and found Gondor but seeing him here this is a very different take and hopefully he leaves the island to found a new city with the southlands to keep watch over Mordor after seeing the sign of Sauron is actually the mountain range including Mount Doom!The story between Galadriel and Isildurs father was great. The connection between the Harfoots and the Meteor man is getting better and with the amount of theories that are floating around its going to be one hell of a ride by the end of the series! Then the best part of the story so far is Arondir and his fight with the Orcs in the deep south of Middle Earth. The Orcs are perfectly crafted in every way, no more CGI giant Orcs, old school makeup and acting is great to see. All expressions and movements can be seen its great to be back at seeing that. The final moments of the episode is awesome that we never got to actually see who Adar is. I can only hope that his structure is one of the Ringwraith as he stands closely to who stabbed Frodo on Weathertop. Or this could be the early introduction to the Mouth of Sauron who helping push the mythology of the character.Overall this is a story that is growing and growing. So much of the second age isnt documented but i hope it continues to adhere to the source but crafting the best stories for everyone to enjoy.",ha77y73ad97,7,1.0,No,Adar,1,1
Getting More Interesting,"The episode starts out a little slow but it soon picks up steam. By the end of the episode we have lots of excitement and left with a cliffhanger that will have you glued to your Prime for episode 4 - youll definitely want to know what happens next!Tolkien purist will hate Adar - a non-canonical evil elf. Im not a purist - I have the books for that. I like what Amazon has created thus far and will continue the series as long I can or until the series ends.All actors are great! Cinematography, costumes, set designs etc... everything is (almost) perfect! Im so happy to see men in costumes as Orcs and not CGI. The actors in costumes makes them a lot more realistic.The story of episode 3 is of will have Elendil and Halbrand as stand outs and I really like both characters. No dwarves here but hobbits return and The Stranger/Meteor Man will say something.Overall I like the episode - looking forward to the next!7/10.",Rainey-Dawn,7,0.44,No,Adar,11,25
Still no vibes,"Some good visuals have started coming, slow motion used nicely. The buildup is still slow. Maybe they wont live upto the standard set by The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Still feels disconnected. The story is getting a bit interesting and this may keep the series in talks for some time but they better start delivering. Orcs were better. The enemy has moved slowly but steadily all this time. For men, it is more to the eyes that we see. Kindness never goes out of way. Nori steals every shot she is in. One of the interesting characters of the series. Die is cast. 2 more episodes will decide the fate. But we will se about that.",moviesknight,7,0.37662337662337664,No,Adar,29,77
Good Until The Warg Sequence,"The episode was good overall but I have to talk about that warg sequence.First, terrible CGI on it... I mean theres stuff from 10 years ago thats better CGI.The chain.... its all over the place. Its taut, then theres 10 feet of slack thats somehow in front of the warg and then it disappears and is taut again, and back behind the warg, as the warg charges into the(apparently brittle roots of a tree thats still living) and crashes through the tree roots shattering them. Then theres this magical amount of slack on the chain again that can be wrapped around the roots several times. Theres just so much wrong with the physics of that chain.Finally, the last elf trying to escape gets shot in the chest, from behind(with a boomerang arrow?) ... I guess so he can turn around all dramatically to be shot in the chest again.I really hope the action sequences are handled/presented better than this in the rest of the series.",Backwards710,7,0.40404040404040403,Yes,Adar,40,99
Solid Third Episode,"8.4/10.Overall solid third episode. With some breathtaking cinematography, beautiful soundtracks, and an interesting plot.I really enjoyed this episode. It started off strong with Galadriel and Halbrand arriving at the Kingdom of Númenor. That arc was the best part of the episode for me. Halbrands attempt to fit in and make a new life for himself doesnt work out since the natives are not welcoming. Galadriel travels with Elendil and finds interesting information about the Southern Lands and Sauron.Arondir and a group of men from his company get captured and are forced to work as slaves by what I assume are Orcs. Throughly enjoyed this arc as well.The only part of the episode that somewhat dragged is the harefoot storyline with the mysterious man. It was the weakest part of the episode for me but wasnt enough for me to dislike it. Ill want to see what they do with these characters later on.",BadurBey,7,0.4608695652173913,No,Adar,53,115
A Slow Start and some inaccuracies,"As a loyal lector of Tolkiens work, I felt forced to take a look at this series. The original trilogy by Peter Jackson was brilliant overall, The hobbit was a little below, but now, this series doesnt seem to be that great. Something important is that the writers and producers couldnt use The Silmarillion for the script, they only had the rights for TLOTR and The hobbit, this includes the appendix. But this is ridiculous since the series goes by the Second Age, all before the events of the Ring. So theres an inconsistency. They are making a big Tolkien adaptation, but they dont have the rights of the actual story of that time. This could have been done better. Why not get the rights and adapt Beren and Luthien?? The children of Hurin? Or even the dramatic story of the Noldor and the silmarills. There they could actually show how Galadriel came to Middle Earth. Anyway, going to the episode, the first remark to make is about Galadriel, Finrod. Was great to show that scene with the siblings, telling what the book doesnt, the good bond between them. Finarfin and Earwen had five children: Finrod, Angrod, Aegnor, Galadriel and Orodreth. The five came to middle Earth, but obviously they cherished each other. But the wrong part was to tell that Finrod vowed to hunt Sauron. That never happened. Finrod was a gentle, wise, noble elve, friend of men, dwarves, who gave up his life to save Beren. He fought Sauron but only because he, Beren and other elves were captured. And he died after killing a werewolf with his bare hands. For such selfless sacrifice and life, Finrod was allowed to live in Valinor again, and walks next to his father. Thats the actual story. Then, Galadriel is shown not old enough for the Second Age. She is the oldest living elve of Middle Earth (without counting Maglor the wanderer), yet she seems to be a warrior and havent met Celeborn yet. She seems to be Elronds friend, but she is actually his mother in law, and Celebrian (her daughter), should be around the same age than Elrond. Thats a huge mistake here. How they will correct it? Celeborn must appear. Also, Gil Galad might be the king, but given who Galadriel is (Finarfins daughter), he shouldnt order her what to do. Besides, Gil Galads father (Fingon, killed by balrogs) was Galadriels cousin. About Celebrimbor (he should be older than what he looks too), great to put him on the series, my only question is, the rings were already made by this point. Still, if Sauron was afraid of Numenor, I guess its a detail.On the other side, there are two more storylines, one with the barfoots. Showed the young Nori, a curious good hearted barfoot, with friends, her father, mother, listening at the old man of the community. And she also noticed a wolf somewhere. Its not bad, but it makes the series slower. Each episode lasts about an hour, and in a few seasons, they should show the rise of Sauron, the fall of Numenor, Elendil, Amandil, Isildur, Anarion, and for what comes next, the awakening of the Balrog in Moria. The evolution of barfoots has reasons to be shown. About the mystery man, honestly seems a great idea. I have no idea who he is, but must be a Maia for sure, if Gandalf (Olorin), or Radagast, or someone else, who knows. The other storyline involves an elve Arondir, and men, women, notably Bronwyn and her son Theo. Its not bad, and no complain about Arondir, he might be a dark elve (Avari, who never went to Valinor or Doriath), and so the non white skin color matches well. After all, there are many kind of elves (Vanya, Noldor, Teleri, Sindar, Dark), and theyre all good. Its not original to make a love story between elves and men, but a woman with an elve, its a change (though I prefer Beren and Luthien). This part also made the episode slower. What lacked the episode is a villain. Sauron should have been present from this pilot episode. During the Second Age, he has a face, a body, he has a form, and is the greatest enemy after Morgoth. So why not use him from the beginning?",tomasmmc-77198,7,0.0,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,0,2
So far this is a start,"The opening prologue to the series lays down the how epic this series could be by the end. That fight scene was graphic and steeped in Tolkien mythology. I totally misjudged where the series was taking place as Sauron has gone into hiding after the defeat of Morgoth! The true big bad of
Middle Earth.Then jumping to Galadriels quest which has started off well but im still not sold on her characterization but that is certainly something that is not going to stop me from watching this. The Elvan way has been shown very well in this first episode and how the honor of the voyage to the undying lands is such a ritual compared to the ending of Lord of the Rings Movie but that is more that 2000 years later! The Human aspect of the world is a weird choice to go with yes they are inferior to the elves but there are still craftsman amongst the realms of men that should viral anyone.Then the worst part of the series which i know is going to be a mainstay are the Harfoots, Northern accents that are just unnecessary to indicate stupidity and lower class. I know these are not meant to be Hobbits but they should be closer to there generations to come. Yes the feet are the same and living in an Hobbit whole/ caravans (gypsies)Overall its a start to a series that im still going to watch the whole way through being such a fan of the original movies and books it would be painful not to see it through!",ha77y73ad97,7,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,1
Far too slow,"The production values, are very high and I appreciate that, but the pace is bone breaking slow! By time they get interesting, no one will want to watch it?! Pick up the pace, pick it up now! You spent, an entire show on nothing but water and having dinner with a dwarf! Do better, think better, be better.The slow pace, of this show is the same thing that killed Firefly. For instance, in Firefly it took forever to get to the teenager being able to kick everyones butt. In the movie (Serenity), it was more succinct and it was clear and clever! Why cant you possibly stop trying to drag things out? If you dont have that much to talk about, just make it a lot shorter!",cnrutledge-28046,7,0.3333333333333333,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,3
Nowhere near as terrible as people say,"The hardest thing for this show from the get go is having to compete with House of the Dragon, which had the head start with a phenomenal two episodes.This first episode is decent. The promotion of the show was selling the visuals of the show and they definitely dont disappoint. The way Middle-earth is presented visually is amazing, you really see every dollar that was spent on the screen. There are so many different environments presented here, all of them distinct and memorable. Everything feels tangible and lived. The CGI is seamless which is a huge praise. The costumes, production and music is all to the highest standard. All of this adds to make a Middle-earth that still feels like Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings.The characters arent that bad either. Everyone feels distinct and different. My only problem is that the Galadriel we know in Lord of the Rings is nothing like this. If she was called something else I would have no problem but the way she is here is going against all we know. I like the half-foots and the way their community is presented, reminding me of the Shire in the beginning of Fellowship.I hope we get more from these characters, thats all Im hoping for.",joshuamathew-03438,7,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,2

The show is quite slow but you can tell its building up and I believe it will payoff. If you ignore the hate around this show you will find a decent show which is only going to get better.

"A good start, though it feels more like D&D than Tolkien","I was not too optimistic about Rings of Power - Amazon Prime doesnt have the best track record (the ok-ish mediocrity that was a Wheel of Time is very recent), the presence of the prefix The lord of the Rings in the title for a story that takes place during the Second Age annoys me to no end (probably more than it should), and of course, the fact it is not based on a specific story makes it difficult to create something (partly) original and yet within the spirit of Tolkiens Legendarium.The good elements: the cinematography, photography and music (by Howard Shore of course) is on par with what you expect and want to see/hear from Middle-Earth. The protagonist manages the difficult task of at least standing up to scrutiny and survive the comparison with Kate Winslett (although I am unsure about the scripts characterisation of Galadriel). The plot line about humans communities under observation due to past allegiance to Morgoth was I think the most interesting addition. I also liked the fact that there was even a brief depiction of Valinor and Morgoth himself.The hmmmmmm elements: Clearly, the presence of proto-hobbits is rather unnecessary; but ok, they seem fun, so I wont mind them; the characterisation of Galadriel as I said seems off. Her adventurer style (leading a party with stubbornness against orders, etc) was I think the least Tolkinesque trait of the series, and what most made it feel like dungeons and dragons instead of Middle-Earth (not necessarily a bad thing, but...).The unacceptable elements: This is going to sound trivial, I know, but I was infuriated with the simply UNFORGIVABLE elf haircuts. Culminating in Elronds utterly ludicrous hair-face combination (no offense to the actor, who is actually doing a good job acting) and all-too-hip in the beginning of time Finrod, the idea that elves have mostly short hair in the style of some kind of fantasy realm Elvis Presleys or whatnot, and even marine-like crop cuts because when they are soldiers, is beyond even pleading to the inexorable Mandos. Even Gil Galad the High King, who tries to be an elf (and who is depicted annoyingly as a bit of a tool), somehow looks like Liam Neeson in a mullet. On a more plot-relevant note, Galadriels jumping off the ship in the middle of the ocean (or rather far beyond the middle of the ocean), makes any way she finds back already bothersome.",Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,7,0.5,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,1,2
Solid Start With Some Flaws,"Overall this episode was a 8.1/10. Solid first episode. As someone whos not utterly familiar with the lore, many of the complaints of the lore being changed didnt really bother me. This set up what would come pretty well. The world building was great and the cinematography outstanding. This wasnt as good as the first episode of House of the Dragon but it was still a great first episode.Cinematography is out of this world. Every shot was beautiful and just marvelous. The detail of Middle Earth is interesting. I loved the way the producers incorporated the map of Velinor and Middle Earth into the show. For someone who is relatively new to the world of Lord of The Rings, this helped a lot.Overall based on this first episode, I would recommend this show as a solid entry into the universe of Lord of the Rings.",BadurBey,7,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,6
Things are making sense again! A better episode,"This is the first episode in Ring of Power that actually feels legitimately a part of the LOTR universe. Fantastic CGI and Editing still continues but this time the characters actually feel consistent, stories tie in properly from original sources to a greater extent and the world building has some legitimate validation. Isildur brings a sense of familiarity to the fans and while Galadriel feels all over the place still but there is hope, they are setting up for a very obvious mental shift in her that you can see coming from a mile away, but its still progress.A step in the right direction, here is hoping this show tries to hold onto this essence and keeps getting better.",abirzenith,7,1.0,Yes,Adar,1,1
Stop Meddling with Tolkiens Masterpiece!,"The Hobbit is a fairy tale. The Lord of the Rings is a legend. The Silmarillion is a myth. All three are masterpieces created by J. R. R. Tolkien, and once asserted to be unfilmable. Twenty years ago, Peter Jackson stunned the world with The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and he did that by keeping to Tolkiens books in every detail. Ten years ago, Jackson did The Hobbit trilogy, this time with some of his own devices, most notably the she-elf and her love affair with one of the dwarfs. At that time, I kind of hoped that Jackson had been more faithful to Tolkiens works, as he had been in The Lord of the Rings, but it turned out to be alright. But thats only because The Hobbit is a bedtime story to start with.The Silmarillion, however, is an entirely different matter. While The Lord of the Rings is about how small people can make a big difference, The Silmarillion is about the pure grandeur of bygone days in the middle earth, about the glory and magnificence of elves in their full power. Sometimes focusing on insignificant people in the grand history makes a solid and touching story, as in The Lord of the Rings, sometimes it just makes a ridiculous confusion. And mingling the lives of ancient Hobbits with the Great Wars, or forcing a love affair between two characters made up out of nowhere into a well-established myth, most certainly falls into the later case. It reminds me a lot of the last season of Game of Thrones, where they ran out of source materials. But at least George Martin was there for them, whereas Tolkien isnt. So please honor his memory, show some respect to his masterpiece, and stop all this nonsense.And the cast is awful as well. Elrond and Gilgalad are the two most un-elvish elves Ive ever seen. Gilgalad looks as if hes suffering from constipation. Elrond looks way too naughty. And Thondir (whom I believe is another made-up character) always seems like hes day-dreaming. Galadriel is the only character worthy of the shows title. For her alone I will finish the rest of this show, but that doesnt change the fact that this show is a fiasco. The Silmarillion is the one book thats truly unfilmable. And they should have left it alone.",GeraltTargaryen,7,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,6

Arondir will be released with an ultimatum for the people with Bronwyn. Elrond will uncover a secret of the dwarves.Over all a pretty good episode that fills in gaps and leads us well into the story with a cliffhanger of great size.

The pacing is a little wonky, the prologue too long, and lacks in some of the personality I would have hoped for, but its also gorgeous and well designed and sets up a number of intriguing plot pointsPilots are rarely the high point of a series, but all in all this left me excited for the future of the series.

6.5. Im looking but I cant find Gold. (Spoiler free),"Im rating this episode not the series, theres still 7 more to go and Im hoping they interconnect and build up on what good points work here.There is no doubt that this looks incredible, it does belong on a big screen really. But is that enough? 500m budget over 8 episodes, any TV show should look good, heck even Eastenders would look great. The acting here isnt anything note worthy, I know the Elves are supposed to be purposefully emotionless to some degree, like a Vulcan- but its just not too fun to watch.As a family piece of entertainment I think it passes the test, it does seem to have something for everybody.I dont think its anywhere near as bad as most people on here are making it out to be but Im not feeling anything like I did when the films came out, maybe Im just getting cynical in my older age. Personally, the best thing about this is how amazingly lush the Elven realms look. There is good use of location shots and environment and the CGI really is something- I just hope they dont go the way the Hobbit films went where you may as well just be playing a game. I want to like this, I do! Lets hope 7 more episodes find its way.",benjaminchristopher,7,0.4117647058823529,No,A Shadow of the Past,7,17
An intriguing start,"I am basing this review off of two benchmarks, Amazons other major fantasy series the Wheel of Time and Peter Jacksons LOTR movies.First the visuals are genuinely outstanding. The costuming, sets, landscapes, skies, CGI, etc. All of it is borderline perfect. This is the level of quality one would expect from a massive budget show and it delivers. Well done.The acting is serviceable but some of the actors deliver their lines in flat monotone which is not good. However I did not see anything that was outright bad and overall it is reasonable.The script is okay, this is an introductory episode and so many things will remain unexplained. I greatly appreciated the general overview of Middle Earth, past and current conflicts, and introducing the scope of the world as we see in the first 15 minutes. I am not an LOTR nerd and have not read any of the books so I cant nitpick any inaccuracies here. This reminded me of the intro in the first LOTR movie as it serves the same purpose. The narration of it was strong though it went on for 5 minutes too long.I think the script lacks some personality to get me more invested in the characters and the world they live in. I found myself asking, at several points, why do I care?. However, it is good enough to get me hooked, which any decent series should do, and I will be watching episode 2. I cannot comment on any supposed story inaccuracies because Im still not quite sure what the story is - which will be a major failing if the script fails to deliver on this front - but I have a general idea.Peter Jacksons LOTR had a substantially better script and more interesting characters but this is a TV series so Im willing to give it time.The musical score is great and feels very much like LOTR.Overall 7/10. I think the haters are nitpicking and exaggerating the faults of this show thus far and those rating it a 10 are not thinking critically. This very much feels like a serious effort to make an LOTR series and commands a sense of grandeur that the Wheel of Time didnt even try to match. Indeed, Wheel of Time feels like childs play compared to the sense of awe I had from the visuals alone.Well done.",bluejays-88045,7,0.42857142857142855,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,7
The adventure of Galadriel,"Visual is good. Well it should be because this is an ambitious project from amazon. And because they didnt make series from other books like children of hurin, fall of gondolin, and took really really small part of silmarilion, so its safe to say this series could rename into Galadriel Adventure. They took different route to describe sauron that even tolkien only focusing on Morgoth. So just take this series as a totally spin off. Im not against diversity but is it too hard for follow the source material. To be honest, it will be hard to fight against House of the dragon without relying on established novel. And its really funny to think this series will replaced GoT even with its downfall.Im gonna see it until end of season. For now the only things pleased me is just the visual.",kyo-bil,7,0.23684210526315788,No,A Shadow of the Past,18,76
"It has potential, but the script has to be fixed...","First of all, I have to say that I have not read the books. I am just a fan of the LOTR and Hobbit trilogies. Yet I know some things about the books, because I like searching across the internet about the Tolkiens world.So, here is my view: this premiere is really good. It gives the show so much potential. The direction and the photography are perfect and make the episode special. The acting is not something different but I can say that we can expect really good moments from the actors.The reason why I rated it with 7 is because the story seems a little... Weak. The script is not very clear about where will this show go. It feels like there will be three different stories going on, with a common clue among them. I know, it is the first episode, but it felt like the writers were afraid of writing what they wanted to. There are, also appearances of characters that we ve seen in the movies. But when I saw them, personally I didnt feel anything. It was just... Some known characters. Something that I put on the script. Finally, the episode is based on the threat of Sauron, which we can feel approaching... But this threat was created from the movies and the writers seem to know that, so they do not try to make this threat even more frightening. It was not necessary, of course, but it would be really interesting to see something more of the evil that is being hunted.Nonetheless, it was a good start and I m excited to see what happens next.",alexioupetros,7,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,4
"A slow build-up, hopefully to sth big!","The first episode was slow, yet a promising start! Many storylines start during this episode and theyll probably be woven together at some point. There are some nice and fun characters... I feel like Galadriel is going to be a round character which evolves from a vengeful/heartbroken/harsh person during the rest of the series into the person we now from LOTR/The Hobbit. There are some other nice characters as well, the half foots for example, aka the beginning of hobbits. The scenery was magnificent and the music complemented is so well! This definitely gets a 10/10. The first episode however, was overall pretty boring. But, Im looking forward to the next episodes.",SusJonna,7,,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,0
A decent start,"Starts off well enough and the opening felt somewhat similar to Peter Jacksons FotR. Excellent visuals and you can tell the sets were very carefully selected and built. The cinematography is very well executed, but some of the action sequences felt a little strange specifically in the snow cave. Acting seemed a little wanting, but hopefully that I dont dwell on that the whole time. Lots of setup so I hope theres more meat later on but overall a decent start that I think Peter Jackson fans could appreciate.Durin is by far the best actor and most Jackson like character I saw in the first two episodes. Excited to see where this series takes us but Im cautious going forward.",zihshtvc,7,0.3125,No,A Shadow of the Past,45,144
Good,"Many reviews are giving it a bad score for being dull and boring and not understanding tolkiens work and I agree that at times it was boring , but it was still a good show. Im still going to watch the rest of the episodes. Can understand why the show cost so much as the visuals are great. Recommend to watch it on as big a screen as you have in your home or you can afford . Acting is great. Overall rating 7.5 out of ten. One of the best Amazon original shows out there, but still not better than the Boys or Invincible , but there are 7 more episodes to the season so well see.",SomeRandomDudeN420,7,0.5714285714285714,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,7
"Solidly made, visually striking, something missing","For a first episode of a new show this is a solid start. The show has already established its tone and feel. Galadriel as the central character is also established well and you get a good sense of her views and motivation.Visually, the thing is quite beautiful. Generally speaking the CGI FX are pretty stunning. Occasionally it can look a tad cartoony, but we are dealing with some larger than life things here and so that is to be expected.So far, it isnt quite as mind blowingly brilliant as Jacksons Lord of the Rings, but:
a) that is a master work and it would be unfair to hold this or indeed any other project (including The Hobbit) up to that rather than view it on its own terms,
b) this is an episodic tv show that has the benefit of having more time to tell its story and that may prove to be a real advantage, but its not going to be as concise or neatly wrapped and a feature length film.",andyinwards,7,0.5714285714285714,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,7
Average start,"It is just not what it was expected to be. It doesnt have that magic you used to feel in the trilogy, Middle Earth is simply not the same.LOTR films are so much longer than this and Ive never fallen asleep with any of the movies but this time has been different. Very dull dialogues and empty scenes.It is true that the music is gorgeous, probably the best of the episode. Also Elrond is also a promising character that may evolve well until we get our wise Harrys Elrond we all loved so much. And that last scene... well something burned inside as saw it, perhaps there is actually some story to be told, and it is not just merchandising.Overall not a solid start, though I hope it will strengthen along the season.",jorgegarciag,7,1.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,2
No vibes yet,"The story has to develop but it seems disconnected as of yet. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a high wall to scale but it doesnt even try. Will see about it in the coming episodes how it fares. Connections are developing but not that great. The makeup team seems to be trying too hard. The scale and landmarks are ok for now. The charcaters are just getting familiar. Slow start to what I hope jsut lives to the hype. This episode focusses of Galadriel a lot. Some conversations are deep and thats how it should be, when a series follows a book, dont create dumbed down versions of conversations, stick to the source. The ending was just the beginning of this series, so fingers crossed.",moviesknight,7,0.5294117647058824,No,A Shadow of the Past,18,34
A few nice action scenes yet all boring,"This show has so many issues I dont even know where to begin. Especially Galadriel and Browyn are probably the most terrible actor choices. Galadriel couldnt be more cringy, how come they found this girl for a very important role. Worst is writing. I have no idea how come shes become the most respected person in numenor all of sudden? She was a prisoner a few days back. Writers failed to reflect this transition. And her motives dont make single sense ; I cannot stop.... Is that it? Some angry girl goes after revenge. This episode gave the hint shes in the dark side actually, clearly its the reason they found this actor. But it doesnt justify her behavior and earnt respect. As for Browyn, she was a helper at the bar at first, now shes leading people. Killing orcs and everything. I would buy it if she could be an Elf yet again she earnt respect of everyone in the village. I think Woke is killing this show so fast. Aragorns doppelganger again is pretty weak, I cant see any ambition in him, in any sense. Black elf is doing a really good job though.At the final scene, the moment everywhere was in under smoke due to volcano, it looked like all main characters died there. After I saw that moment all I thougt was I couldnt care less. If its the final scene of entire show and there wont be any other episode, its fine by me.On the other hand, people are talking about great visuals, CGI etc. I think its a given nowadays. All big budget productions have it, so I dont see anything exceptional here.Alright, GOT and LOTR are totally different productions but they are the only ones we can compare with this. After Im thinking cliffhangers, character developments, actors and eveything in those show/movies, this one falls terribly short. Directing, actors, writing are simply boring, uninteresting. Ill watch the entire season of course but I have zero excitement.",mertafor,7,0.3300653594771242,Yes,Udûn,101,306
Forget Sauron: Galadriel is the shows main villain,"This episode is action packed and follows - mostly - one story line, so I found it easier to watch than the previous ones. The scenery, action, special effects, and battle scenes are - as usual - top notch. The music comes also good into play. The focus of the episode are twists: you will find a lot of them, and unfortunately a few times this will seem forced (with convenient last minute save the day scenes). I believe many will find this episode entertaining, and action-packed, after such a slow five episode build up.But lets cover now the obvious minuses. Maybe the top #2 problem of the show (and I will come later to what I think is #1) is the lack of character development, backstory, and motivation. Three examples:
Brownwin: how do you expect of her to perform such battle acts, killing orcs left and right, giving her profession? Either she could serve by healing others, or - much better - in the five-episode build up, some scenes could have been included in which she was trained to fight (for example, it could have been a secret hobby she and her Elf love-interest could have shared, while he would have train her)
Isildur - he was the potential to become a big hero, as he started to save the day - but his motivation is so weak and there is little congruence from episode to episode. Does he fight for Numenor - or doesnt he even believe in Numenor?Galadriel - here is maybe the top issue of the show - the hero with the most screen time - its a bloodthirsty villain. Her dialogue with the orcs leader proves it: she thinks that all orcs are a mistake and she wants him to be alive only so that he can see how she kills all his children (orcs) and then she will kill him as well? Really? The writers didnt feel the Nazi vibe here?Then ok, if they want to go to such an extreme in her inner conflict of what is bad vs good, then I would expect that the next episode and seasons will focus on her redemption: realizing her mistake and fighting for peace, even protecting orcs.Personally, I found this framing too much and too risky: how can we get attached to the show if the main characters motivation is I cant stop and kill orcs, as all orcs are a mistake?Too bad as the story had so much potential. I still hope the writing gets better and that we will see a fully-round show (that doesnt rely on the scenery and music to deliver really bad character lines and development)",valentinilicea,7,0.5,Yes,Udûn,6,12
A Darker and Unnecessary Turn,"Im going to disagree wholeheartedly with the majority of the reviewers on this episode. I like the show so far and felt this episode took an unnecessary turn for the darker that sacrificed story for violence. It was unnecessary to see the orcs slaughter and be slaughtered for almost an hour. The worst of it was definitely the orc taking a knife to his eye and bleeding into Arondirs mouth, but that was just one instance. Tolkien abhorred the wars he experienced in his lifetime and would not have supported such scenes. Im fine with creative license for the sake of good storytelling, but this felt for like Sapkowsis Witcher universe than Middle-earth.Also, just a small quip, but Im disappointed with the Adar reveal (or lack of). The show also needs to pay attention to time. The Numenoreans ride at day, but the battle the join takes place at night into early morning. Small details matter and this is the third episode where things like this have happened.",megan_chatterton,7,0.26666666666666666,No,Udûn,8,30
"Adar, hero of the working class","It looks like a lot of people are praising this episode, mostly with the, excuse me, but rather shallow argument battle scene! Action! Hooray!.Now, the battle scene was good, and yes, it was welcome, there has indeed been little action so far. But I cant quite get over the whole we are in an extreme hurry to rush to a completely random place we havent heard of, where a battle we know nothing about is happening, and jeez, we arrive just on time. To be fair, this is an extremely Tolkien-y thing to happen. The professor did love his last minute deus ex machina very, very, very much. I do not.I did however very much like Adars defense of the Or..Uruk. It is good to turn towards a not completely black and white, obvious good vs obvious evil balance, and I absolutely praise that. He made Galadriel sound like a fascist, and though I am not sure that was the effect the series was going for, Im all for it.What I could not get over was the bizarre end. The mysterious artifact is used, breaks down a dam so the water floods the river bed and the tunnels the orcs had dug, and then... the water stream ends in the volcano causing the volcano to explode? Edit: I read an article that claims the concept is geologically sound, although extremely simplified, as the water should end up in the magma chamber, which is not reached by a tunnel dug beneath the villagers house, but ok; since there is some logic to the basic concept at least, Im willing to let this slide - showing the transformation into Mordor is a good idea, although the lack of Saurons involvement in it is a bit icky.",Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,7,0.3125,Yes,Udûn,5,16
Wheres Sam Ramie?,"I found this episode to be cliche. It reminded me of The Army Of Darkness that attempts to take itself seriously, or perhaps Monty Python Meets Middle Earth. During the chase scene between Galadriel and Adar I half expected that wed see a rendition of The Black Knight Skit with Galadriel hacking off Adars limbs while he tauts her to fight. I have to admit, that would have been entertaining.What we got was an extended fight scene that was at times rather stiff, over-acted, and corny. Like when the villagers locked away in The Tavern all gasp in unison as the Ocrs hit the door with a battering ram. Really. It was Army Of Darkness Redux. Wheres Sam Ramie? And not to have that comparison outdone, I felt vindicated when some dam broke for some reason and suddenly water fountains in massive gushes out of the villages wells. Yep, if the water had been blood wed have had Ash Meets Middle Earth. Give me some sugar baby! ...villagers gasp in unison. Or when Bronwyn gets an arrow through the back and chest, and the arrow is pulled out and the wounds cauterized with a red-hot iron because she is next to Deaths door. And then in the next scene she up and walking around chipper as can be. Really? And then Mount Doom blows apart searing the village in a pyroclastic flow of red-hot magma. I bet all the characters who got covered with the searing wall of death show up in next weeks episode. Sam Ramie should have been given the budget to produce this show. Then it would make sense.The episode did have it moments when it returned to the LoTR narrative as we find out more about Adar and the creation of Orc and Adars dislike of Sauron.Like 300, it would be fun if a producer made a film that simply had fun with the plot. I constantly felt like the episode was going to break down into comedy and laugh tracks. You know, Meet The Numenoreans.I still marvel at the scenery and settings but I tend to be disappointed in the casting, acting, and attempts to be inclusive - or serious. The show has so much potential. It needs to concentrate on substance and Tolkiens lore.But...worthy effort.",connda,7,0.3333333333333333,Yes,Udûn,4,12
Very well directed.... everything else - meh,"We are not 6 episodes in, and finally something has happened. This episode was actually pretty good, for the most part at least. One thing I noticed, and I dont know if it was just me, or was the colour grade different this episode? I was much darker and more bleak, which I believe helped set the tone of this episode. This was rated 15 (UK) and they took full advantage of this with the gory action scenes.The action scenes were pretty well done, you could clearly see what was going on, with several long shots and no quick jarring edits. I have heard some say the episode was too dark, but I watched this on a 75 4K TV and it looked amazing. The director of this episode does a reall good job with this one, she has directed some good TV episodes in the past, and ep6 really benefits from her style. However, her good directing could not save this from the awful and bland characters. The battle scenes could have been even better if we actually cared about those in them. Each time a main characters life was at risk, I felt nothing. This is really bad for a series now 6 hours in. The dialogue is the same as the previous episodes - silly and horrid. It tries to sound wise, and while there are some good lines in this particular episode, they come across as cheesey because the actors delivering them, just arent right.Udun is the best episode in the series by a long shot, it is well directed, shot and is visually stunning. But thats all it has going for it. The characters are all still boring, the story is all over the place and the writing is poor. Undun did leave us on a pretty good cliffhanger, the whole creation of Mount Doom was nice to look at.",Dannyboi94,7,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,4,12
The One (Two) Tower(s),"Getting closer to the end of the first season, some things did start to happen.Considering that in the previous two episodes, the ships were trying to sail out of the harbor and couldnt because of incomprehensible stupid complications, were on the right track.There are quite a lot of action and comedic moments in this episode. Little of whats going on makes sense; again, its unclear why there are so many unnecessary scenes. The dialogue is still weak, but occasionally a couple or two good conversations make their way through. The choices the characters make are still not entirely clear, though. Galadriel is trying to control her eternal rage, and Halbrand is rewarded for not wanting to go and do anything, essentially with crowning. Its okay, but it saddens me since Aragorn had to endure much more to earn his title.Its not clear at all why the peasants decided to take the fight, given that they had what the orcs needed and were allowed to leave. The twist is, again, stupid, but it at least led to something of scale happening.The orcs also behave pretty strangely. Its not clear exactly what level of threat they pose. The defense scene in the village, in general, looked like a spin-off to Home Alone but with orcs. Lots of comedy especially shining through the tavern defense scene. Im not sure why the orcs didnt just burn it down and find the thing they were looking for.Many scenes from Two Towers are replayed, which does not work well because there is no particular empathy for the characters. And the stakes were minimal.The action scenes were done well, and the Arondir&amp;Brownyn music theme always gets me. Too bad their relationship doesnt play.Id say this one is slightly better in all respects but the dialogue and lame twists.",kuarinofu,7,0.2857142857142857,No,Udûn,4,14
Poor acting,This episode had more action but kind of poor one especially the fight between Arondir and the big Uruk. I felt like I was watching a WWE fake fight were the ork was letting him win. The rest of the episode was OK but we cant stop compare the episodes with the mighty movies and theres always a gap between them. All this hype created big expectations and because of that we all are more strict to the critics. I dont know what else to write for this episode but I hope next season will be more careful and bring new decent characters and more action. Maybe if HBO or Netflix producing this series would be better.,georgikopoulosfotis,7,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,1,3
"An in-depth episode review. Summary: Cant believe it, an actual good episode? Finally, the story we wanted to see and they wanted to tell arrives, yet too little too late.","Starting with the attack on the Fortress, the ugly orc has great make up and the orcs, as usual, look quite nice. Some of the elaborate mechanisms to allow Arondir to fight them all is a bit contrived but the scene is energetic and has decent editing so no complaints there really.Meanwhile, in Numenors fleet. Isildurs interaction with Galadriel is one of the better written scenes of the show, a first for Galadriel where she didnt hate the other person. But, the armors stand out like a sore thumb as the worst I have ever seen. These are no armor made of real materials but rather a fashionably stylised version of what I assume is based on its aesthetic inspirations. And Elendils explanation, or lack thereof, of how his wife died plummets the scene. Its a frequent flaw in the show, right when they have something good (Isildurs exchange) it is soured by what seems to be an attempt at being vague when Elendil says she drowned... Wow, thanks for that elaborate phrasing that ties into nothing. They could have written the scene so it ties to Isildurs exchange, but nope, thats too hard to write I guess. Why use a poetic allegory to what is being said when you can straight up just spew the relevant info in the straighest of manners...The scene where they protect the village starts promising, with the tension being built by Bronwyn not being able to lit up the kart but managing to use an orcs death in their favor. But why does Arondir have a fist fight with a seemingless unarmed Orc? Why isnt it armed or uses his weapons (if he ever had). However, the fight is cool so nothing to complain, although it ends quite predictably. How these villagers manage to kill all Orcs is beyond me, but I guess its a medieval fantasy show so Ill give it a pass. But the reveal that most of the orcs they fought were actually captured villagers is shockingly effecive yet not for long, because if you think about it for a second: they really didnt have to fight, if they had stood still or warned them of the actual attack they could have at least died in peace, but they chose to fight and never actually utter a word to reveal who they were... However, again, Ill suspend my disbelief and go along with it because it shakes things up and makes the battles conclusion that much more interesting (and also I really didnt see it coming). Though, I didnt need the Bronwyn is dead gimmicky scene, its overplayed in movies and I hate it. She is the main character, she is not going to die, carry on.Adars scene of the gory intimidation-tactic killings, is shocking and convincing and the resolution of the scene has consistent writing. Arondirs elven ways would never allow him to give away the weapon of the enemy, not even to save the one he loves nor the people he was tasked to protect. However, thats not the case for Bronwyns son, who couldnt allow them to kill his mom.The late arrival of the Numenorians to the battle is perfect, because if they had arrived in the nick of time it would have been unrealistic narratively. So what the town is right next to the coast where the boats docked? So nice one on that. However, yet again, Galadriels fight scene is unrealistic as from that angle theres no comfortable and strength-driven position she can strike from but whatever, I guess she is an Elf and elves have supertrength. The rest of the focus in Numenorians fighting is engaging and we get to see the hardships of battle through the young soldiers, Isildurs friends who have interesting developments further on in the episode. The chase scene is an obvious call back to the pursuit by the Nazgul of Arwen while she takes Frodo to safety. But the conclusion is nice and it sets the mystery of Halbrands secret motivations... AgainMorgoths flashback and Sauron: finally some backstory to the evil man who inspired the bad guys. However, slightly overviewed and yeat again never shown. And is Galadriel racist?... Adar presents the case that orcs have names and hearts, they have a right to live despite how their ways of finding a home are evil and wrong. There should be a case made from reason and not dismissed for a mad rage for vengeance. Although it does suit Galadriels character arc I suppose that shed react and think this way... And it eventually does. FINALLY WE HAVE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR GALADRIEL. The long awaited motives and themes that will follow Galadriels arc as this shows version of her. And I like it, particularly Adars calling her Uruk, an elf motivated by hatred and darkness, for it circles back to Episode 1 when her brother told her Sometimes, to find the light, you must first touch the darkness. Its generic and tired, but its a classic fantasy theme and I like it. It reminds me of the dark side from Star Wars.Halbrand &amp; Galadriel sitting on a tree. Wow, this romance is blooming, I hope they take it slow and doesnt become as cliche as it looks like its going to be. Which it wont because, unless they rewrite the lore, which I hardly doubt given how mad Tolkien fans are with the show and they are 50% of their audience (minimum). It is well known, Galadriel has a husband and he even appears on the Jackson trilogy so, they got their hands tied on that one I guess. But I hope they take it. I dont think it diminishes or takes away from Galadriels quest nor her arc, I love me some bantering yet blooming romance. Although it would help if I knew more about each of this peoples motivations...However, something generally bugs me of this episode: the whole shake it off attitude. This line is the solution to all of the characters internal conflicts. Halbrand has an internal struggle with his past? Galadriel tells him to get rid of it; Bronwyns kid has an internal struggle about the sword? Arondir tells him to get over it... I feel these are whacky contrived ways of introducing or simply saying out loud characters struggles for the audience to know for the future. Like, blatantly planting the seeds to gather its fruit whenever... Thats, I guess understandable, but its just frustrating because it prolongs the release of new information that we so desperately need as context or development for them, particularly with some of the main characters who, STILL, have motivations unknown to the audience. We are actively supposed to be involved in and cheering after these people we know little about... I suppose Halbrands past must be super revealing because up to know it has been questioned but never answered and it makes it hard for the audience to invest ourselves in him. Is he good? Is he bad? What is he, what is his personality? His motives? One scene he is joking around and fighting like a pro and the next he is super dark and mysterious... Also, Arondir, why do you give the sword to the kid who JUST NOW told you he has an unstoppable desire for it? Jesus, sometimes this show... But I guess it is saved again by a BIG reveal that the sword was actually snatched by or given to (I guess we have a new mystery in our hands, who could have given it to him?) the evil villager to use for inserting in a hole that came from nowhere, put there by Sauron to fill the tunnels the orcs have been carving to channel the water into the volcano and get our Pompeii moment witnessing the creation of Mordor... Wow, didnt see that one coming, for real, it is that convoluted and unnaturally occurring. But I guess I like where it is heading towards, finally some plot after 7 episodes!I swear I dont understand the filmmaking choice of having Galadriel just stand there still... Its not epic, it looks stupid and unhelpful to others. Can we please have a human reaction from her? Even Arondir moved away to not get hit by meteors, none of which ever targeted Galadriel for some reason, but he managed to help others AND react to the current events effectively. In their never ending quest of making Galadriel look epic and larger than life the realistic portrayal of the other characters just drives home the point that they are inconsistent with one another. You cant have an all powerful character as a main character, it never worked. Gandalf was powerful but he wasnt the main character (for long), the protagonists need to be relatable and to be relatable we need to connect to their strengths as well as their flaws. Galadriel doesnt seem to have any character flaws, she cant be bothered to be scratched by anything nor made vulnerable because we need to have an attempt at an epic or rebellious scene. It still doesnt work and I hope to god they at least give her some good character arc otherwise she will be unbearable for no reason.IN CONCLUSION, I liked this episode. First decent, solid episode. There were no unintended funny scene nor weak characterizations for the most part. The plot of the show finally unravels so we get to see the status quo change for a change. No general complaints just, happy we have an entertaining episode to what so far has been (and is) a hit or miss show. Some story threads are worth following in this show and others arent as much unless they are all connected. Thats why this episode works, because some story threads not only LEAD somewhere (finally) but they connect with one another, complimenting each other quite nicely. Cant wait for the other story threads to connect too. And also, enough with mystery characters, its time we learned of the identities of at least half of the mysterious characters introduced (I get not-Gandalf remaining a mystery for longer but we gotta know about Halbrand at least)",quiqueperezsoler,7,0.2,Yes,Udûn,1,5
Things are happening BUT NOT REALLY,"I really tried and actually still trying to get attached to this show. But something is missing and I think it is with the way this show is written or constructed overall. Especially for the fantasy fans (not just LOTR) we want to BELIEVE what they deliver. I want to believe the characters, the struggles they have when fighting the evil, I want to be engaged in the storyline and interested in the characters fate and their development.Here honestly... I dont. I find it very hard to believe the characters and I dont think it is because of how actors play their roles, but because of how they are written or because how the creators envisioned them overall. Here the storyline and character development seem...blunt, linear, flat.The dwarves are indeed well portrayed, how they look and how they act is very believable. Durin especially is very charismatic and his interactions with Elrond are sometimes lovely and funny. They somehow remind me of Legolas and Gimli. Sometimes I wished to see more of them.When it comes to the elves... I have a very big issue and it seems I couldnt get over this. I really tried to not get bothered by them but here I am, stuck at episode 6 and hating their hairstyle. I hate they didnt give Elrond a cool elf hairstyle. Or the others as well. Elrond had a lot of potential of looking GREAT as an elf. I dont have anything against the darker skinned elves, but I DO have something against their ears. What the f is up with those? Why couldnt they just give Elrond and Gil-galad a more esthetically pleasing pair of ears? Why? Just why???? Galadriel is so sleek and elegant with her cute and delicate pointy ears while Elrond and especially Gil-galad have those big, fat ears. Why they couldnt just give them ears that SUIT they faces... This makes me sad and I couldnt get over it. I tried to ignore them all the time but they are THERE and I am aware of them constantly.The battle scenes could have been much more better written or planned. Some scenes in particular stood out, like the one in the previous episode (ep.5) when Galadriel sword fights some men in Númenor. I found that scene a little...silly. Again, Galadriel is very elegant and a good actress (although the script does not work in her favour) but it is how the overall scene is presented and how they fight... for me it was silly. Maybe I am exaggerating, but do you remember that scene in GOT when Arya returned to Winterfell and has that sword fight practice with Brienne? Something like that I was expecting.I am really trying to not compare this show with other fantasy ones but it is very hard not to. And not only with our good old LOTR. But even with GOT or HOTD. In HOTD for example, after 1 episode I was hooked and after 2 or 3 episodes I was invested in some of the characters fate. I am eager to see the next episode. Here not so much. It misses that fantasy glare.. I dont know how to put it. I find myself watching it and realize I am watching a movie at the same time I AM WATCHING IT if this makes sense. I dont want to feel like I am in my bed when I watch fantasy movies. I want to be there, in that world. To get attached to some of the characters or to really hate some them, to want some of them to triumph and destroy the evil, to forget I am in my bed watching them and at least for a half an hour to BE there. This is the main thing that I think throws me off when watching this show.I wont start detailing the fact that I dont understand how they could make 1 hour episode and give almost no useful information (episode 5) and then have this episode when I feel like I was being rushed to the end. It is as if they lengthen too much some scenes when they really didnt need to and other times they just go to quickly over some scenes where I wanted and NEEDED to see more.I gave this a 7 just because I am very big fan of the LOTR lore and I had very high hopes for this one. I know there must have been a lot of work put into this, some scenes are good, some of the sceneries are exceptional (see Númenor) but because of that things that I find missing.. it is hard to see this as a consistent show. The twist at the end of episode 6 was indeed nice and interesting, but it needs to be consistent all way through.",larisasuca,7,0.1,Yes,Udûn,1,10
Well its better than the previous one but still average,"This episode suffers from the same thing the other episodes suffered from; bad writing, cold performance, and add to that mediocre fighting choreography. The first 45 minutes of the episode felt lame and kinda boring even though action scenes were present, but they were not enjoyable and you can easily notice the medicore choreography, and everything felt kinda rushed but then after more than 3/4 of the episodes, without spoiling that much, things get really interesting and important things are revealed and finally a nice twist that made me excited and interested in the upcoming episode, the show is still medicore but if they manage to make things right from the upcoming episode and forward, I think it can be saved.",omalola-14223,7,0.0,No,Udûn,0,4
"Episode 1 is a Prologue, and Felt Like It","Many impressive aspects to episode 1 of season 1 of Rings of Power.But it definitely felt like a prologue.Sweeping landscapes set up the world but there is little plot that is driving the viewer. The main action is Galadriel seeking Sauron in the far north.A range of acting is on display, from competent to very, very good. Especially well done are Arondir and Bronwyn.The Harfoots are a bit strange but fit into the fantasy landscape comfortably.Overall the episode sets up quite a few possible outcomes for many characters.The production quality is first rate for a television show.

1. Elfs dont seem like Elfs that weve picturized post Peter Jackson trilogies - the showrunners should try sticking to that
2. The warg looks more like a corrupted cute pet dog - than a wolf-like creature that PJ used in his movies.

I also liked the Harfood ones (To be honest, I thought Id hate them). I want to enjoy the series even if I see many points I dont think is right.Also I dont really think there will be second season.

Disappointing,"The finale, like the preceding episode, is disappointing. As if having an uneven season wasnt bad enough, they managed to even make the season finale dull. Was the show really as terrible as some fans claimed? Certainly not, but neither is it that good. The season as a whole has lacked any sort of heart, and this includes but is not limited to the shows sluggish tempo, its very thin characterization, and its wooden acting. The final result gives the impression that the only goal was to cash in on a well-known IP, and it comes across as being dishonest, as if the creators werent really invested in the show. Beyond its stunning visuals, The Rings of Power hasnt really accomplished anything. There were certainly some high points to the first season of The Rings of Power, but they were more homages to the Peter Jackson trilogy than original creations. This was a decent way to kill time, but otherwise leaves one wanting more. With more seasons to go, theres hope that the shows creators will iron out the kinks. They have everything they need; they just need to put it together in the right order. If a season finale is done successfully, it should leave you feeling something at the end of it. Unfortunately, I felt barely anything after seeing this. I wont miss the show, but it had enough positives for me to return for a hopefully better next season.",ahmadz839,7,0.4,No,Alloyed,2,5
Bit disappointed you see....,"It was already very obvious with all the setup from previous episode that who was who. All that was expected from this finale was to how they write it and direct it. Nothing wrong with the ending, but the banger with which they ended the episode 7, I wouldve loved it had they ended this season with the same impact. Probably needed a proper sequencing of events. (Like Star wars revenge of the Sith, where the ending shows Darth Vader rising).Another thing is when you want to use references from LOTR triology, you use them with subtlety and not leterally copy and paste them. People watching the episode will understand what I am trying to say. At one point you say enough of this.All in all, i enjoyed the show, and i hope they get renewed for second season, and hope they come back with the banger because story-wise its pretty neatly written.",ronakale-24744,7,0.26666666666666666,No,Alloyed,4,15
Maybe expectations were higher...,"...because this was the finale, after all. However, although Im a fan of the series (despite being determined not to watch it at first) this episode had a lot of weak spots. It did feel rushed.The Stranger story wasnt adequately developed, there was very little dialogue, a lot of menacing faces, a lot of running - around Harfoots... it felt a bit silly, to be honest. I was expecting to see the Harfoots settling down and forming the first Hobbit village.The Hallbrand twist (many had predicted this!) again felt quite off. Weve seen Hallbrand being mysterious, but again, I feel there was dialogue missing. Sometimes I feel the original LOTR movies were able to say it all (all 3 books!) in 9 hours, you know? And that this series, although the acting is great, lacks quite a bit in writing, it feels weak and maybe trying too much?But I like how the Miriel - Elendil connetion grows, I absolutely love both actors, they are fantastic and very related to the original material. As is Galadriel actress, the scene with Sauron in the sea is like she IS the younger version of the LOTR Galadriel. That was some great acting there.What I absolutely hated, was the finale song. You know when you watch a so and so movie and then they add a garbage pop song at the end? Yes, that was the feeling. It was the absolutely worst choice for a Tolkien atmosphere. When the title score is wonderfully fitting, so majestic and elvish (of course, when its composed by none other then Howard Shore himself!) the finale song lacks in .... everything. Its uninteresting, doesnt really have a melody, the singers voice is annoying (definitely not menacing, just annoying) and I hate it with all my might. Such a dishonour for Tolkiens words of pure literature magic. Not a great way to finish the series. Ill just go on YouTube and remedy what I just listened with a clip of Cate Blanchetts pure gold narration.",DianaFiD,7,0.15789473684210525,Yes,Alloyed,3,19
Saved by the bell,"It was nice to see some proper twists finally. After almost entirely terrible season, seeing something surprising was good even though there many details dont make sense. However even this episode is full of many dull moments, especially in the drama department. Meaningless, long and boring conversations, showing the same scene over and over again... Directing and editing couldnt be worse than this. Its really sad to see such potential is wasted by inferior writing, directing and acting.Thinking about the entire season, this is the first episode this show brought something interesting to the table for the better or worse. Im not sure why they chose to make such an uneven season but hoping that they can tell the story better in the next season after they utterly failed to build up.",mertafor,7,0.15789473684210525,No,Alloyed,3,19
Good finale in a universe where viewers know the end,"+++This review is spoiler free+++1. The story has some minor plot holes that are not dominant or break the viewing experience, but some scenes were just overdramatic, too long and... one story line was missing alltogether.2. Emotions emotions emotions. The screen time focus is too much on how characters feel. It bugs me with many recent shows. Especially the new Star Trek content. Luckily this is not as bad.3. Content had the right balance for me. It tied in well with Silmarillion/first age content we got from Tolkien. Though Tolkien nerds may be angry at the oversimplifications and casual viewers wont get many of the Silmarillion/first age references.4. Subvert expectations: Artificially tricking the viewer can be a great tool if it is subtile. There was a decent one and just a bad one.I dislike the lazy way many of these modern shows are made. Very unprobable weird occasions that build up to the next super random moment. Many characters feel authentic, but the story itself has too many sloppy/easy excuses to justify things.The set team did some great efford, especially early on with a good love to detail, but the story just does not feel like a naturally evolving one. It feels like the script writer had a starting point, a fixed end in sight and had to fit some character arcs in between. That is true for most stories and the real achievement is to make them feel natural. Make decisions feel relatable.",justus-286-332754,7,0.13333333333333333,No,Alloyed,2,15
Enough to make me want to watch more.,"I cant abide with all the one star reviews that this episode has received. There are things that have held back mine and others enjoyment, the pace is slow, the script unimaginative and repetitive, the characters in this episode looked like theyd been cleaned up/altered with CGI, and the music score doesnt reflect the drama like the Peter Jackson versions of Tolkiens work did.That said, I did like the reveals (even though predictable), the story at last seemed like it had found its path and the frustrations from previous episodes were resolved. I think everyone can agree it wasnt great, but it was OK (maybe verging on good?) and quite frankly, I enjoyed watching it, with small bits of frustration as I went along.Heres hoping that they polish up what should be a rich and engaging fantasy universe in the future.",robin-55689,7,0.125,No,Alloyed,1,8
"Enjoyed it, nice finish to the season","Season 1 did a great job capturing the lore and magnificence of Tolkiens world. Not perfectly or without flaws, but its also a TV show written from notes and appendices.I went in with low expectations and came out pleasantly surprised. The visuals were incredible, and the characters had a lot of passion with much likability. It was refreshing to see Sauron/Halbrand exhibit humanness and a sort of good/evil conflict, as it added much needed depth.There were many things that could have been improved, but overall they were small. I think too many want to hate it because it has to either be perfect or its a complete failure.The Rings of Power is very much an origin story, and I think they did an excellent job laying the ground work.

Better than the rest of the series. Still not as good as it should be.,"The finale was decent and a big improvement over the boring episode that came before. Finally something was happening and it was decently made. Although I still dont get what Saurons plan was. Why was he helping Celebrimbor, only to abandon his project when Galadriel found out about him? Why didnt he just kill Galadriel or something? Now he just appeared there to help the elves make the Rings, but he wasnt there to corrupt them, so what was the point of his quest?It all seems very far fetched and its pretty weird that Sauron just proposed to Galadriel to become his wife. Really? A Sauron and Galadriel love story? Odd choices all around.Still, had some fun with this episode so a 7/10 for this episode and a 6/10 for the rest of the show.",daniel-smits-03179,7,0.36363636363636365,Yes,Alloyed,8,22
Dwarves have vibes.,"The story grows but way beyond of the hype. All this on one Billion dollars, doesnt seem so. The sets need to have been better, even lighting wasnt good sometimes. Maybe they fixed the budget solely for cgi, which isnt even great yet. Dawrves stole the limelight for me. And dina, my queen. She was great. The friendship and the anger was the take away. The ending of the episode was on curious note so we will see about that in next few weeks or so. This ending will keep the dialogue open for a week atleast. But they have to deliver better than this. Once again stating, could have been a lot better. It is the kindness of ones heart that keeps all the evil at bay. But are we kind? The fireflies scene was so sad.",moviesknight,7,0.2,No,Adrift,1,5

Looking for more but understanding the story,"This series is very Hollywood version of Middle Earth, the fun of the original trilogy was that it seemed so real, practical effects and cinematography but this has a weird tone to the whole episode. Its closer to 300 blue screen than the volume that the Mandalorian had used. The lighting seems weird for the elvan and human realms. Whereas the Dwarven kingdom was epic!Thats not to say that i didnt enjoy watching the episode, the man that fell from the sky is still such an interesting figure for the series. Im still leaning towards to Gandalf since his magic seems to be revolving around fire where he possesses the fire power ring in LOTR. There are calls that this is one of the blue wizards which would be great as weve already seen 3 out of the 5 wizards of middle earth.Back to the dwarven kingdom this was such an awesome showing of power and how the mighty can fall leading to the orcs taking the mines of Moria. So much of the story of Elrond, yes he becomes a great warrior but the diplomat is truly come to the forefront. Most of that story is going to grow and grow.The small details that have been woven into the conversions such as the Hammer that crafted the Silmarillion stones along with the trails of Dwarven mythology were awesome.

For me a really interesting twist,"So much of this series has been setting up the next series. The first half has definitely been a slow but world building start. So many viewers now of any series are expecting such a grand start that has to be in the story right from the off but this episode is yet again proof of the old school style of story telling and details that are being laid per episode.The way that the last episode ended was just epic on a middle earth scale along with the Strangers story and then Mount Doom finally being shown just aims us 3 to 4 series down the line where we are seeing the final alliance of middle earth.Theres the other side of Galadriel of the caring nature after the explosion. Which can only grow in the 1000 years to when she finally meets Frodo. So much of the story isnt true to Tolkiens works but is certainly filling in the gaps of the missing years. I cant deny that i want to know more, this is amazons target to fight Star wars and Game of thrones with their own prequel filling series.Overall story is being laid for greater thing, never a bad thing but can understand where so many reviews are coming from lead to people switching off until it gets epic, for me its already epic.",ha77y73ad97,7,0.0,No,The Eye,0,5
The Most Unexciting Penultimate Episode Ever.,"Let me start by saying, I have enjoyed this show, which is why this episode pains me to no end. I thought everything that built up to episode six largely paid off after seeing the creation of Mordor and the battle of the Southlands. This episode picks up where the last left off, and doesnt even attempt to keep the momentum of its predecessor.Instead of revealing more of the shows mysteries, it meanders from scene to scene, conversation to conversation. Some of the dialogue is good and I found of few of said conversations to be emotional, especially the ones with Durin and Elrond.We finally get a good look at the Mystics, and before we know it theyre gone! We learn nothing about them, we learn nothing about the Strangers identity, and nothing about who Sauron is. To make matters worse, the promotional images and videos for the episode actually teased that more would happen. Evil Finally Reveals Itself , The Time Has Come , and More Will Be Revealed. They literally lied to us when teasing this episode, which is why Im more upset than I otherwise would be.In conclusion, this is my least favorite episode. This is coming from someone who has liked the series for the most part, however this as a penultimate episode doesnt do its job. Instead of building upon the previous episode and mounting momentum, it drags its feet and goes almost nowhere with the plot. There were enough nice scenes between characters for me to sit through it, but thanks to some terrible marketing for the episode, I was left feeling a sense of longing for more.",alasdairboswell,7,0.36666666666666664,No,The Eye,11,30

What we have here is an absolutely stunningly shot show with good acting, but the story and pacing could us some work. With how these first two episodes went, being practically all set up, following multiple different stories, it is clear this show is building to something they are confident in.

Story develops slowly but not steadily.,"Last episode really put up the steadiness of the show. But today it got slow again. I like the slow growing of charcaters til we get familar with all the happenings, but it shouod be steady too. The old stranger man is a bottle of hidden gems. Everytime he suprises you in ways you never think of. Oh, for sauron to born they have to make a sacrifice with that ancient knife. Kinda wild. Maybe the old man has to be the sacrifice. For men, we have to answer the call. We are not our ancestors. The things they did wrong doesnt mean we will too. Only if we hold true to overselves. Politics is always something which ruins ever good thing. Truth will set you free. The hidden agendas wont. The balrog fight should have been little bit longer. Durin is weak.

"A bit of storytelling, a bit of characterization","In the fifth episode of the Rings of Power series, the creators go into each of their storylines, and yet, it still seems that the plot is barely progressing. This means there isnt enough development in the storylines to make each episode worthwhile. But why is that? What is the problem with the series?! It seems hard to say; Because the creators of the series, trying to achieve a false sense of greatness, have forgotten that they need great characters and stories to shape their story. Thus, in the episode Partings the scenario is not of wandering power rings, but of lost ground.The Rings of Power series, as a beautiful canvas that wanders everywhere in Middle-earth without a specific purpose, does not have a single story. Therefore, with such an image, the best moment in the episode The Great Wave had nothing to do with the story, that is, the focus on the traditional ritual of the dwarves of Moria. From this point of view, the best moments of the fifth episode or Partings are also a wandering montage of Harfoots journey, showing maps and legendary flashbacks about the creation of elves.The fifth installment of the Rings of Power series is at least built around a fairly consistent set of themes, themes that fit well with the shows largely straightforward moral worldview. And at the same time, they can balance between the eternal themes of Tolkiens works and contemporary issues. At its core, the episode Partings argues that Circles of Power is about the importance of political altruism, about the need for disparate groups to trust each other and work together for the greater good. Its a very simple idea, but its also a heavy and interesting one.Its a theme that runs consistently throughout the episode, from Arundirs decision to stay with the humans to Elronds loyalty to Doreen. This also fits well with the larger political themes at the heart of The Lord of the Rings.In his writings, Tolkien always considers humans to be the weakest race. Not by force, but by will and according to morality. Rings of Power keeps this concept, but expands it to other races to fuel the fire of further conflict.However, this newfound thematic consistency would be more impressive if it served a greater sense of movement for the series story. Now, its easy to see how the various narrative threads fit together thematically, but are largely unrelated in terms of common purpose. With episode five coming right from the halfway point of last season, the Rings of Power series has been strangely stuck in place. In conclusion, this series works best when it paints a picture of an open world, but it should let the characters explore it. All those who wander may not be lost, but all those who remain do not know where they stand.",4liReza,7,0.3333333333333333,No,Partings,1,3
High-Budget Grrrrr Power Fan Fiction Isnt Always Awful,"This show was of course doomed to be just fan fiction when the producers failed to buy the rights to the Silmarillion, and was further doomed by cut-rate writers, even if the special effects cost a gigabuck and look worth every penny. And of course the writers were obliged to deconstruct Tolkien from a timeless twentieth-century author with nineteenth-century sensibilities, into a twenty-first century feminist. I am reminded of those lower-paid fan fiction auteurs who do away with Kirk and Spocks inconvenient heterosexuality, or with Doc Smiths gender distinctions.But the low- though over-paid writers are genuinely pretending to try to imitate Tolkien, and Tolkienesque atmosphere and prosodic echoes slip through often enough, and with a big enough budget, to make the show worth watching with judicious and extensive use of the Fast Forward button.",flash-104,7,0.0,No,Adar,0,1
A steady ship is better than an erratic one,So much of Tolkiens original work is slow building and tiny details that will certainly pay off in the end but i can see where the general viewer may lose interest in the story. By the end of this episode we truly get to the point of where the story of this series will get to.One of the most important things that this series had to deliver on was the cinematography and the CGI since the budget have been revealed to be close to 1 billion by the end surpassing every record for a series ever eclipsing house of the dragon. There has been moments where the costume designers have fallen short in compression to out HBO friends this is where the series has come into its own. The sun lite isle of Numenor and the harbor that most of this story is based around is just epic.Then leading to the story with the Uruk Adar having the presence of Joseph Mawle behind the character is the best tread that should always be pulled in this series. The subtle creepiness of his character and the hopefulness of the elves along with the doubtful humans in the story really balance so well.We know where this next episode is going to lead and i cannot wait to watch this!,ha77y73ad97,7,0.0,No,Partings,0,2
Nine minutes,"Eight minutes and 50 seconds, to be exact. Thats the exact number of quality scenes in the entire first season. With all of them condensed into the last episode (mostly being Galardiel - Halbrand* by the river scene).Overall, I cant say Im disappointed. There was so much silliness, bad acting, and virtue signaling in the first season that by the end of it, I had learned to mostly ignore or laugh it out.I dont know why so much screen time was spent on the Harfoots and all those scenes other than trying to build up a weak twist. The last-minute Sauron twist wasnt believable at all, and even a non-fan would never be confused by that.Describing the season as a whole, it could have turned out pretty good if it was 5 episodes instead of 8. If they hadnt wasted so much time on nonsense. If the dialogues had been interesting. If some of the important scenes were not directed in a laughable parody manner.Overall, I would rate the first season at 6/10. The last episode was failure-proof, or at least hard to mess up. It also looks like somebody is helping with the dialogue, because in some scenes it feels like 200% better than on average. Maybe there is something to this.If you subtract the visuals, its 4/10.If you are a more hardcore Tolkien fan (which I am not), 2-3/10.",kuarinofu,7,0.3387096774193548,No,Alloyed,21,62
"Entertaining, could be better","I have given it 8, solely for the reason it has kept the original LOTR kind of scenes, and visuals. But the casting has been so poor.The casting for the elves is so bad. Whoever casted Elrond needs sacking. And the so obvious complete copy of merry and pippin with the two hobbits is pretty laughable.However. It was been enjoyable and entertaining, and looking past the poor casting it is a great picture.Hope Elrond because more and a strong character as atm due to the casting of his character I am not convinced.Arondir the elf has a lot of potential. I think this character is well casted and could turn out to be the savour of the series if he meets my expectations. Also the stranger is so clearly Gandalf.I hope this gets better as it goes. 10x better than the new boring as per game of thrones series.",mutton-56597,7,0.3333333333333333,Yes,Adrift,2,6
Feeling Optimistic,"The trailers were drawing attention to all the wrong aspects. Like its gonna be good b/c of you know, representation. This doesnt make a story good or bad. People are deeper than their gender and skin color.Galadriel is a by the book Girl Boss, so you know already that shes going to be right about everything and shes like super righteous and unlikable. Her predictable arc will entail a moment when everyone has to say Galadriel, we should have listened to you. We should have recognized your Girl Bossness from the start. etc So righteous. Eyes bulging. Shaking with girl boss righteousness.But now, despite that, two episodes in and I like where it is going. I like most of the characters and theres some interesting things happening. The hobbits are done so well. The Dwarf city and king and queen were great. I like Arondir and Bronwyns subplot. The look and feel of the world is quite good. I like using the maps to show us the different parts of the world. The music is pretty good too.Lets see if it keeps moving and doesnt get weighed down by too many characters. But Im feeling optimistic. So far, good job.Im not going to compare it to LOTR anymore. Its something different and should be judged according to its own merits.Did I mention that Galadriel was like really righteous?",jdgxiv-137-669358,7,0.4,No,Adrift,2,5
Pleasantly Surprised,"I couldnt have gone into this with lower expectations but I must say I enjoyed these two episodes much more than I thought I would. I say this as a dedicated lover of the Peter Jackson films as well as all of Tolkiens work. Its not perfect by any means, the hobbits having these horrific fake Irish accents is painful to watch and to hear, also something seems off with the portrayal of Galadriel, as if she is just some rebellious teen rather than an ancient, wise and very powerful elf.I am warming to a lot of the story lines, especially the elves, the inclusion of hobbits however isnt grabbing me at all. What really shines in Rings of Power are the visuals and the soundtrack, both are absolutely stunning and have once more sucked me right into the world of Middle Earth. Looking forward to the rest of the series.",alexcoughlan-82019,7,0.38461538461538464,Yes,Adrift,5,13
Better than the first episode but a little uneven,"The first episode I gave a 7 but it was a soft 7. This is a strong 7.It has more personality and humor. The characters are better realized. Khazad dum is glorious and the relationship between elrond and durin is well done.It is a little uneven. Not every plot line is as strong as the others. Elronds story and the harfoot story are well done, the others feel a little bland.Id be curious to know what was shot on location and what in the studio. Most of the sets are beautiful but a few look a little bit like blue screen. I wish in general fantasy and sci Fi stopped going for the highly artificial HDR look, and instead worked to exploit the limitations of their medium. This show isnt the worst offender (the MCU is) so its more of a trend I dislike than anythingIn terms of quality among fantasy shows this isnt as good as a good game of thrones episode but I liked it more than virtually every other fantasy show, namely the Witcher, that streamers have tried putting out.",elljawa,7,0.47058823529411764,No,Adrift,8,17
What is the fuss about Mithrandir,"The Maia that has the sole purpose of being the ambassador of worlds people and bring them together against the evil, not by sheer magic or force but by reason, logic and the power of the tongue, arrives in a commet, doesnt know language, looks and behaves like a caveman. Thats the most disturbing deviation in the series so far.Also why did the producers skipp 90% of content from Silmarillion? This show could have been teeming with content at a much higher pace. I mean, hundred page long sector of Feanor forging the silmarils from the light of the twin trees is mentioned for about 15 seconds. The war of Beleriand is mentioned for about 10 seconds. What is wrong with the producers. This is not a low budget production to shy away from portraying big war scenes.",cemtrhn,7,0.6363636363636364,Yes,Adrift,7,11
Silence the nay sayers,"Ive never written a review before, nor will I again probably.Ive read the books twice for my own pleasure and once for three sons. I love LOTR but Im no die hard.The first three episodes have been a bit of a slow burn, but interesting at the very least. Such is the requirement for character development, contrary to the ensemble of hate spitters Ive heard over the past year.I thoroughly enjoyed this episode. Was it perfect? No. But can you name a previous entry that was? They are all invariably flawed but thoroughly enjoyable. As was this.

Made me feel like a kid again,"Growing up on the Jackson movies and then later reading the source material and its accompaniments like The Silmarilion, The Middle-Earth franchise is a big comfort for me. Perfect escapism. Im not sure whether its the fact I had low expectations of Rings of Power or wether or not its genuinely wonderful but I had a blast with this first episode. Where to start? How about the visuals? Breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking. Rings of Power is supposedly the most expensive show ever made and honestly, I can see it. Music is up next. Bear McCreary and Howard Shore both do a stunning job with the soundtrack. Of course with Shores involvement the atmosphere of those first three films is maintained but also built upon with the inclusion of McCreary, who has previously worked on the recent God of War, Black Sails and the Walking Dead just to name a few of my favourites. Acting? Pretty darn good. Theres a few performances I dont care for but the brunt of the main cast do an excellent job and keep me attentive. Of course, acting is only ever as good as the writers allow and the dialogue, like the acting is mostly pretty solid; theres a few questionable lines but I found myself quite impressed with the dialogue and pacing. Its not perfect but it is far from what I thought it might be and for that I am grateful. A Shadow of the Past gets a strong 8 to a light 9/10 from me. Hope it can stay consistent.

Off to a great start!,"This first episode was a great relief. This show is going to be solid. The characters are good so far, the writing and dialogue are fine, the sets and New Zealand scenery are amazing. The show looks fantastic. I cant wait to see more.This first episode was pretty heavy on dialogue, and exposition, but that is what youd expect. Im guessing the pace will pick up in the 2nd episode. We did get a cool troll fight, and a glimpse of some Ents. Not sure who meteor man is yet, but Im definitely hooked to see what happens next.The naysayers, race whiners, and timeline purists who want this show to fail are going to be seriously disappointed at how good this show turned out to be.",thadwhit,8,0.2235294117647059,No,A Shadow of the Past,38,170
Returning to Arda,"It was a boring start. I hope it will not continue like this.It can be said that the episeode is visually satisfying. Especially the Lindon scenes were pretty good.The Southlands scenes were far from engaging. I do not care about Arondir and Bronwyns romance.The actor who plays Thondir looks more like Gollum than elves. Even the last name is almost the same, McCallum.Despite the fact that the Game of Thrones universe is looked down on next to the Lord of the Rings universe, the Rings of Power had an unsuccessful start compared to House of the Dragon, its prequel which started almost at the same time.",alaeddinkuyuk,8,0.42857142857142855,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,7
Solid start for non Tolkien fanboys,"I watched this with my 9 year old son and we both really enjoyed it.Im not sure what people want from art these days? Perhaps they want a personalised experience like they get with most other things now, but with TV and film you get what youre given and for me this worked. We Really enjoyed it and we will watch the whole thingIf youre a Tolkien fan and it didnt work for you thats a shame, but maybe they made this for the mainstream to get as many eye balls as possible. Crazy idea eh.They have clearly spent a lot of money on this as it looks fantastic - but allegations the 1st ep is dull is just plain wrong. Its got plenty going on for a wide age range. Quality entertainment for the family!",hazzaboombatty,8,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,4
You need to accept the pace and let this episode settle you in.,"I see a lot of people stating that this episode moves to slow and sets you up with pretty much no clear storyline(s). Thats why they released the first two episodes together. They obviously couldnt put these 2 into 1 episode as that would be too long. So they made sure you got to see both the introduction and that first look into future plots. If you dont accept this (especially if youre a Tolkien fan) you dont know what youre looking at in the first place. Tolkien could spend pages talking about different shades of grey in one place.The episode to me sets a nice base for what is to come and in what places the stories are going to start unfolding. Galadriel seems like a very nice main character to follow. Kind of the Jon Snow of this series and even the new Elf seems to me like a perfect character to show us some of the more untold history of Middle-Earth.Visually the show is already a masterpiece. I love how much of this is practical. That to me was always one of the main reasons I loved the LOTR trilogy from Jackson. Because all digital visuals today are going to one day be outdated. A very decent practical set will not.The acting is great. The language being a main character in this world is being spoken right and with a feeling very similar to that in the Jackson world.I do hope that the stranger is not going to be Gandalf. That seems like a cheap way of playing the old nostalgia card. A untruthful way of grasping onto people who dont understand the importance of the accuracy in the story and its characters.All with all this episode is a great way to get you seated, buckled up and set for take-off. If you didnt like it that much, dont worry, you will start feeling the urge to fly in the next one. As long as you remember to not be greedy for more fighting, twists and epic scenes filled with balrogs and wizards. Tolkien takes time. Thats not the Tolkien way either. Amazon seems to take its time to deliver a full and honoring story. Thats one of the reasons I still put my trust into this series. Thats the Tolkien way.",citycraftcrew,8,,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,0
A shadow of something greater..,Yeah i am gonna be honest and say i knew this show was gonna be disapointing before i even watched it! LOTR was a sensation back then! Something no one thought was possible! A product of its time! Recapturing that same feel 20 years later is just not possible!The visuals are the best part of this show and it is obvious where all the money went! But it takes more than amazing scenery and visuals to make a good show! The story feels hollow and not very engacing at this point! Instead of slowing down it just keeps jumping to the next set-piece!This show might surprise me but for now i am just dissapointed! The biggest achievement could be: most expensive mediocre show!,andmikkelsen,8,,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,0
I had such high hopes for this show...,"And the first episode didnt disappoint. The story follows Galadriel as she seeks evidence that Sauron endures. She and many of the other key characters are ordered to stand down or go home and the last Great War is declared to be over at last. She is granted passage to Valinor as a reward for her heroic deeds, but it is in fact a ruse to prevent her from investigating further as it is believed that her very actions could be the catalyst for Saurons return. She, and others, feel drawn to follow their own destinies and it seems the moment they decide their own courses coincides with the arrival of a meteor that crashes down and exposes a figure, a stranger, seemingly wreathed in flame.",mfrey-42921,8,,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,0,0
Promising Start,"I was very critical and hesitant about this show. The trailers didnt look that good and all the other stuff surrounding it had my expectations lowered significantly.Im glad to say that this show is actually good so far. Im intrigued in the story, the characters and the world. And it actually feels like Middle earth, I say that confidently as my favorite movies of all time is the LOTR trilogy by Peter Jackson.Im not a lore fanatic and francly do not really care about it that much, i cant really tell how lore accurate this is, but from what ive heard its pretty mixed. Tho the LOTR trilogy also took a lot of creative liberties and didnt follow the lore beat by beat. So I dont really have a problem with it.If you like LOTR you should give this a shot, also if you havent yet seen anything middleearth related, you should also give this a shot.",nilsderkerkhoff,8,0.3333333333333333,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,6
Groundbreaking and potential to be legendary!,"I Just watched the first episode and was very happy and eager to watch episode 2. Galadriel, Arondir, Elrod and Nori are excellent in their roles in this exciting and captivating prelude to the middle earth saga, all taken from Tolkiens notes!, may we have ten seasons!The Silmarillion, the Children of Hurin and The Book of lost tales are eagerly awaiting their screen debut. Amazon has show with the Rings of Power that they are up to par with the task of taking the helm to bring these last 3 books and a new re-make of The Hobbit, while maintaining faithfulness to the novels.Having these last great additions to the Tolkien collection and florescent narrative of the middle earth history, find its way into a series such as this would be very fitting because it would allow the full story to be told in all its glory. The middle earth saga has never found its equal and remains Lord of the greatest fantasy ever written!As to the question of diversity, I have some explanation as to why other races are now in middle earth. Amazon I hope you will take notes and in season 2 address this important issue that is being discussed very strongly on Twitter and other social media and which must be addressed.It is clear that the races would keep to their own during those times but for circumstances that called for the presence of a few delegates or representatives of different lands. However besides these specific or sometimes remarkable reasons why certain members of foreign visitors would be so far from their lands, their presence is most welcomed. If one takes Rome for example, the city had an influx of peoples from every corner of the world as it was a central governance during those times.Simarly middle earth would have people from all over the lands in certain locations for specic reason., traders, explorers, teachers, military regimen etc.I find it beautiful and grand that members of every race will be included, well done.The cinematography, sound, lighting, costumes, sets, architecture, history, musical score, CGI and monster creations etc. Everything is beautifully handled with attention to detail and expertly done thank you Amazon!",jc-29071,8,0.3333333333333333,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,6
Untangling,Exciting episode which shows some acceleration in the plot in contrast to the wide and tranquil exposition of the last 3 episodes. The story seems to be getting very slowly untangled but this allowed for building up the main characters.There is still a lot of mystery left for the viewers like me who havent gone through all of Tolkiens work. Filming and production are as beautiful as ever and I am failing to find the cause of all the hatred towards the series. I have seen far worse productions getting praised and high rated and I do not believe the current rating reflects the overall quality of the show. There are a lot of things to be improved but so far I have enjoyed the watch and am expecting an even better continuation.,bace_anti,8,0.32575757575757575,No,The Great Wave,43,132
"Amazing scenes, terrible casting","I have given it 8, solely for the reason it has kept the original LOTR kind of scenes, and visuals. But the casting has been so poor.The casting for the elves is so bad. Whoever casted Elrond needs sacking. And the so obvious complete copy of merry and pippin with the two hobbits is pretty laughable.However. It was been enjoyable and entertaining, and looking past the poor casting it is a great picture. Im looking forward to the characters delevoping and creating a relationship with the viewers. I think some of the ratings are rather harsh. But This was going to be case in following the most perfect trilogy and casting of all time.I hope Galadriel grows into her character as at the moment I also feel shes fairly feeble. Definitely no Kate blanchet. She would of been perfect for the role had it been done back when the films were made.",mutton-56597,8,0.2,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,5
Better then I expected,"They put a lot of effort into this, sure it bends some rules and probably throws a lot of canon out (maybe a smart idea, not everything Tolkien wrote is good for the screen). I thought the plot was sensible and I can see where things are going. If youre the kind of person who cant focus and will start monkeying around with their phone once the director drops the Michael Bay act perhaps you wont like it. The cast puts in a decent effort, the pacing is right for tv, theres little hints here and there of whats coming, and some interesting mysteries where Im guessing what happens next. I dont understand the bad reviews but.. I think its got to do with how people just cant sit still and enjoy something anymore.",dbasutton,8,0.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,1
Starting to hold its weight. Fire is lit.,"They finally understand to keep few stories flowing rather than a bits and pieces of all of them. Dwarves are interesting. Once again proving the fun one of all of them. The friendship of Dwarf prince and elf is tested again and again. They are going to make a powerful dynamic in this series. For the parts of the men, they are taking slow motion in action too seriously. Every action scene need not to be slow motion. The pieces are unfolding together. I am now sure the man in the comet isnot sauron. Or is he? For the men in numenor, the queen understands. She is another interesting character in this story. The way she takes decisions is to be kept in mind. Good visuals. Maybe lighting can be better at few places. The ending of the episode is the good spark that I have on this series to light the fire which should have been lit in earlier. But better late than never.",moviesknight,8,0.4166666666666667,No,The Great Wave,75,180
Might be the best episode so far,"After what I thought to be the weakest episode yet in episode 3, this one probably is my favorite. I feel like the show finally found its footing and settled down, I thought the dialogue was better and not all over the place. Most of the storylines have me convinced now, especially Adar/Southlands and Elrond/Durin. Have to add a word for Elrond/Durin/Disa, say what you will about the rest of the episode but the scenes involving any/all these 3 have been the peaks of this show, both the acting and writing have been the strongest here son far. My biggest question mark is still the Galadriel/Numenor arc but at least its going somewhere now and the storylines will merge. Also, it was nice to finally see some other version of Galadriel that isnt always angry or lashing out even though we still got our weekly dose of it lol.Not a fan of the slow motion action scenes though, I think it cheapens whats going on and feels more like a dream or something.Also, I like the slow pacing but to each of his own I guess, I wouldnt want more action just for the sake of it as there isnt much going on right now in terms of conflict. Id rather have them set up those conflicts well rather than hastily rush into them.",mcemerden,8,0.39622641509433965,No,The Great Wave,63,159
Dangerous Liasons - E04 Review,"Character arcs started to bloom in earnest this episode. My reviews of preceding episodes contain more details, which is why I chose to keep this one as concise as possible.Director Wayne Che Yip did great work here. Writers Stephany Folsom, J. D. Payne, and Patrick McKay wrote a superb script. Outstanding cinematography as well. Thrilling scoring, editing, and sound effects. Superb hair-makeup, costume, art direction, set decoration, and production design.Queen Regent Míriel, played by Cynthia Addai-Robinson, was alluring. Kemen (non-canonical), played by Leon Wadham, was intriguing - a relatively new entry this epi. Pharazôn, played by Trystan Gravelle, was memorable. Eärien (non-canonical), played by Ema Horvath, was curious. Galadriel, played by Morfydd Clark, was superb. Elendil, played by Lloyd Owen, was great.Halbrand, played by Charlie Vickers, was portentous. Adar, played by Joseph Mawle, was notable. Isildur, played by Maxim Baldry, was good. Valandil (non-canonical), played by Alex Tarrant, was under-rated. Arondir (non-canonical), played by Ismael Cruz Cordova, was inspiring. Bronwyn (non-canonical), played by Nazanin Boniadi, was engaging. Theo (non-canonical), played by Tyroe Muhafidin, was great. Rowan (non-canonical), played by Ian Blackburn, was remarkable. Waldreg, played by Geoff Morrell, was excellent.Vrath (non-canonical orc), played by Jed Brophy, was outstanding. Elrond, played by Robert Aramayo, continued to impress. Celebrimbor, played by Charles Edwards, was good. Prince Durin IV, played by Owain Arthur, was great. Princess Disa, played by Sophia Nomvete, was admirable. King Durin III, played by Peter Mullan, was great - another new entry, who would later become the first among the Dwarves to wear the mightiest of the seven rings of power that were given to his race.All other cast and crew did noteworthy work in Rings of Power episode 4 now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.This episode, The Great Wave, made me realize that I will never get tired of watching Amazon Studios version of Númenor. We also received essential reveals for characters like Halbrand (heir to the royal Southlands line) and Adar (most probably an Elven-origin progenitor of the orcs). Speaking of, the orcs continued to impress. The writers lent them a surprising level of empathy, which I greatly appreciated - the orcs werent always bad.Some outstanding sequences with the broken sword of Sauron further enriched episode 4 Rings of Power. Work also began on the later-to-become-legendary tower designed by Celebrimbor to forge the titular rings of power. They also touched upon the old mine, which hinted at a place where we may later get to see the Balrog. They did inform us quite clearly, though, that Durin had discovered a new ore there, namely Mithril - made famous in Jacksons trilogy.Númenors mysterious king in the tower was revealed as well, and in its own right held portent aplenty. Before long, a Palantir (one of seven ancient scrying stones) was also revealed, thus imparting strong Two Towers (from Jacksons trilogy) vibes. The future of Númenor, as detailed in Tolkiens books, was given its own frightful highlight.They also played Halbrands cards close to their chest. His Hulk smash style super-strength in episode 3 was apparently a key element to be explored as the show progressed and not to be revealed too soon.The escape and chase scene featuring Arondir and Theo felt like an interesting throwback sequence to Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Frodo, and Sams experiences with Sarumans orcs. Near episodes end, some enthralling hints at a Helms Deep style battle to come, and a stunning mention of Sauron from the mouth of one of the Southlands folk - enough to whet fan-appetites for days.All these elements ideally balanced the fourth episode, which somehow managed to give nothing away while also giving a taste of things to come. This episode proved to be another superb one from Amazon. It shored up sundry foundations for the rest of the series to stand upon.Since when did one week start to feel like one month?

Pleasantly surprised,"Throughout the first three episodes, I was disappointed with this show. A plot that seemed to be going nowhere, a cast of characters that were too dry (except Elrond and Durin)...
But after this most recent installment, Im beginning to care and the show is putting its hooks in me. The characters are beginning to show promise. Halbrand (beginning in episode 3) is beginning to show promise, Durin and Elrond continue to shine, and even expressionless Galadriel showed some heart in this episode when faced with a difficult emotional situation, though I still would have liked to see more from her.The plot is kicking off as more things fall into place and Im actually getting excited to see where the show will go as we see Halbrand, who might possibly be ------ remains in Valinor and Galadriel manages to rally the forces of Valinor to fight. And the rising fear in the Southlands - especially the tension with the sword young Theo has been using - is beginning to feel real rather than a fever dream.Though there is still some dialogue that could be better and the plot and characters have yet to fully unfold, this episode excites me for the future of this story in a way that the previous installments have not.",jjreeder,8,0.2616822429906542,Yes,The Great Wave,28,107
Mystery and Danger,"° Decent interesting start.° My favorite scenes were those of the female elf, the black elf, halbrond, and the kid.° I yawned sometimes, but i enjoyed it more.° I had a feeling that the orcs could later do something once darkness would happen.° The kid is smart. I wonder if he with old guy would later become servants of Sauron hmm.° I like the friendship between the Dwarf and the elf.° Im kinda curious about Isildurs story, but for now i dont remember him much or find him interesting as much as some others.

"Its not LOTR, but its a great show!","The final episode was rather slow but the twist was completely unexpected. I would still rank it as a solid 8.If you try to compare it with Peter Jacksons masterpieces or worse yet, with the majesty of the grand master, Tolkien himself, you are setting up a bar too high.If you compare it with the other shows on air right now, its an excellent creation. Despite being a hardcore GoT fan who thinks the last season was not THAT bad, I would say the Rings of Power made a better prequel.The actors did a decent job, the VFX team did an outstanding job. The story is intriguing. I would say the finale left more for desire, but still I applaud for the effort they put.I just hope people would set aside their dislikes for Bezos taking over the story, and comparison to the aforementioned masterpieces and appreciate the effort the artists have put. I would highly recommend the show.",hossain-itrat,8,0.16666666666666666,No,Alloyed,4,24
Huge and Wonky,"Theyve created a huge canvas and are developing four story lines and doing so in a lore-rich universe. I have no surprise that some people are struggling here. But by episode four story lines are becoming clearer and characters are making sense. There are some great references to the Tolkein universe generally, future and past.Wed typically give a new show three of four episodes before we decide to carry on. The Wire took five, but by that time we were seriously hooked. Battlestar Gallactica we were hooked from episode one. I think that the problem Rings of Power have is that it has taken a while to grow some characters and consolidate story lines. Well stick with Rings of Power to the end.Cinematography is fantastic. Im enjoying the Harfoot hobbits now, and like the folky styling. It feels very consistent with Tolkeins inspiratiopn for these people.But, one thing that is irritating, is the acting. Mostly very good, some strong characters. But theres an inconsistent mix of accents. American and British actors have not made much effort and are still distinguishable. It just feels odd. Id expect people from the same place to speak in a similar accent.And Lord of the Rings generally suits a gritty British drama style. Rings of Power has a made for US TV feel. Star Trek, Battlestar, they all suit the made for US format. But in Lord of the Rings the Hobbits were from the Shire, absed on middle England and home county shires of Buckinghamshire and Berkshire. Except maybe the Elves, who were more drawn from the tree-loving Finnish. Point is, Rings of Power, while treu to what Tolkein wrote, is not true to Tolkeins inspiration. Its a good, enjoyable show, just a little wonky.",GabrielSymes,8,0.0,No,The Great Wave,0,3
By far best episode of the season,"As LOTR fans, we are not happy with this season. However, this episode makes sense and completes the old episodes.Why episode eight is the best? Let me list;* It completes the season. We had gaps in some action scenes although they were epic. The episode makes those scenes sense. Also, some of the background stories would become trivial if they did not decide on such an ending.* Dialogues are better.* Smooth fight scenes, you do not get bored or distracted from anything.* We see better acting because of the better dialogue again.* And we have one epic confrontation scene which is the most pleasing most satisfying one.",Basitharmonik_,8,0.19047619047619047,No,Alloyed,4,21
People need to remember that this isnt GoT...,"Once you get past the fact that this show and story overall isnt as grown up as you would like it to be, its actually not that bad. Like the movies, it would seem this show is catered to the same age group, which is fine. It looks great, too. And being such a huge fan of the ASOIF world, its actually nice to have a less brutal fantasy depiction on TV that you can just relax and enjoy. So far Id give the first 2 episodes a 7 out of 10, with this episode being an 8 and the first episode being a 6.

This episode however was a significant improvement. The action sequences were thrilling and the plot is thickening and forming. The acting and cast were great and I epically enjoyed Elrond and Druin in this episode. Their dynamic was fantastic and refreshing and reminded be of Legolas and Gimli, which is great. However the show still has some pacing issues and it still feels uncertain of the direction it wants to go. I do hope that moving forward things keep improving.

Another solid entry.,"With episode one, the pacing was a bit slow admittedly. To say it was boring would be a lie, as I was totally enthralled with the world building, but it was slower placed to be sure. This is Lord of the Rings however, so I expect some slower pacing sometimes to build characters and story.The second episode delves deeper into the world and the characters. I particularly enjoyed Nori Brandyfoots character. Markella Kavenagh did an excellent job as the character. Shes curious, smart, and full of wonder about the world. The Harfoots (Harfoots are ancestors to Hobbits) are the heart of Tolkiens stories, so its important we see that reflected here, and we do!We are introduced to Durin and the relationship and friendship between Elrond and himself in this episode. That was super enjoyable, and definitely my favorite part of the episode. They absolutely nailed the dwarves. I especially loved seeing Kazad-Dûm in all its gory. Gimli spoke so highly of that place and I can see why. It was magnificent. There are some little nods to the Jackson films in this part of the episode as well malt beer and salted pork made me smile.So, overall another solid entry. I am waiting to see where the story goes and I think the episodes will get even better each week. Give it a chance. Once again, this is an adaptation, not the books. Book purists give it a bit of a rest, will ya? They are not disrespecting Tolkien here.",alasdairboswell,8,0.375,Yes,Adrift,3,8
Getting better,"Its true that the first episode was not so good if we consider that the first episode in every show should be strong and exciting, but the second was much better in all aspects.We cannot judge the story and the writing from the first two episodes because this is not a random tv show, the lore is huge and it can get even bigger with this show..So we have to let it grow and let the writers express their type o pacing
I truly believe that it is gonna turn out really well
The second episode was truly exciting and keeps the viewer occupied throughout the whole episode.Also,what this show gives me even better than the lotr trilogy so far (sorry for the comparison)is the menacing nature of the freaking orks..I knew that aragorn and legolas could easily kill one of them with no effort but here ,I think these orks are far more powerful and scary ..",batzalos,8,0.42857142857142855,No,Adrift,3,7
Adrift...,"In this episode, Galadriele, not wanting to travel to Valinor, jumped ship and ended-up in the open sea. Drifting for some time, she comes across a group of people in a broken boat, who reluctantly let her in. As it later became apparent, their ship was attacked by a giant sea monster, which attacks them again.The other plot introduces us with Lord Celebrimbor and Elrond traveling to Kazad-Dum (Dwarven capitol) to acquire some needed materials for the forge, however, the local prince wants none of that, because Elrond had abandoned him for twenty years and no, Elrond has to make amends to his old friend.The third plot takes us to the Haarfoots, wherein Nori and Poppy are trying in-secret to take care of a giant, who has fallen from the sky and figure-out what to do with him.The fourth plot takes-us to Arondir and Bronwyn, trying to figure out what has happened to a nearby village and who dug up a tunnel leading to their own village.Overal, the episode had more potential, because people were doing more this time, not just talking.+ Atmosphere

Leaves the viewers wanting for more!,"Ive given my feedbacks for the 1st Episode - the only let down I felt was the Elfs - short hairs - less knowledgeable - stays the same for this Episode too - hope the showrunners correct this soon!Now the +ves!The pace has certainly picked up! 1 problem with picking such a large time duration of the 2nd Age wouldve been that - you would want to show as many details as possible - but that would make the whole show so boring!But the showrunners have handled that so well. They picked up Galadriels journey to be the center of the season - which is turning out to be really interesting now.Gladly looking forward to see how Galadriels character transforms from a young Elf warrior to such a strong Elf witch - that weve all seen in Peter Jacksons trilogies!Highlights:
1. The worm
The showrunners are certainly making the budget count. We got a glimpse of it in the maps in the 1st Episode - and this Episode shows the horror of it live
2. Moria
Glad to see Moria in its glory days. Another area where fans like me will look forward - how the mines transform into a living hell with Durins Bane - as we saw in LOTR 3rd Age.",emailmonomoyghosh,8,0.375,No,Adrift,9,24
Dwarves and a more coherent story make for an improvement,"The second episode prominently features dwarves, which immediately raises the level, as everybody loves dwarves*. Even better, the dynamic between Durin IV and Lady Disa is great, to the point of helping Robert Aramayos Elrond into making me momentarily forget his atrocious hair. The interior of Khazad-Dum in all its splendour is also glorious.The naked man who fell from the sky among the primitive hobbits is extremely obviously Gandalf. I am still not sure how I feel about this plot thread: its clearly an excuse to get hobbits in the story, and the idea that Gandalf was thrown randomly, alone into Middle-Earth by the Valar without memory, speech or a staff (and also youngish, but ok) is the kind of thing that might make Christopher Tolkien rise from his grave to damn us all for polluting his fathers work, BUT the segment is really well acted and the end with the fireflies is really good.Galadriels story is also somewhat salvaged - in the sense that ok, running into two different sea vessels after jumping into the ocean in the far end of nowhere is rather iffy, but at least the script avoided my two greatest fears: that she would just come ashore somewhere without an explanation of how many decades she had to swim, or that Eagles would appear.All in all, I am getting more hopeful after this episode, it is still not superb by any means but it does seem like it could shape up into a good show.*apart, apparently, from utterly ridiculous people who are actively debating whether dwarves and elves are allowed to not be white. There are things to criticise about the shows adherence to Tolkiens vision and world, but this is not one of them.",Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,8,0.42105263157894735,Yes,Adrift,8,19
Second episode is MUCH better,"So I gave episode 1 a 5/10. I thought it was messy and confusing. But this. This is good! The characters spring to life. Disa is freaking wonderful and the stranger is super mysterious (of course Im 99% sure of who it is). There are some interesting character interactions. Especially the relationship between Durin and Elrond and how wonderful it is to see Moria in all its glory, although its likely only gonna be for a short time.I feel a lot more immersed in the character development and the stories. It makes me forget that the elves look a little weird. Especially Celebrimbor. Hes a lord among elves, the master smith and he looks like a maester from Game of Thrones. Thats sad. And I still think its sad that Theos (among others) sword wouldve looked so much better if they didnt have those unnecessary hilt guards on top of already existing hilt guards. So I have grievances with the costume and prop design, but as long as the show is good, its possible to see past that.",joelmester78,8,0.42857142857142855,No,Adrift,9,21
The show knows where it wants to go.,"By this point all the plotlines and characters are well established and the show clearly knows where its gonna go from here. It still has some little twists and turns. Is Adar really Sauron and where did he come from and what happened to him? What are the lies he is referring to? What exactly is that hilt that Theo found and where is the conspiracy regarding Sauron going to go? Pretty good stuff.Galadriel keeps disappointing me though. Her 2 character traits, determined and angry is still all she is about and I understand that especially the writing of her character gets a lot of criticism. A lot better is the interplay between Elrond and Durin and every LOTR fan will immediatly recognize the similar bond Gimli and Legolas had. Lots of good banter and humor. Also great to see Moria in its heyday and to see more of Dwarven culture. I also like the bond between Bromwyn and Arondir. Its perhaps a foreshadowing of what LOTR calls a last great alliance between elves and men.Of course we know what is going to happen but there is still some mystery left and im genuinely excited for the next episode. Its just better to enjoy what we have and see the good things in a product instead of being angry. The show is never going to recapture that first time we watched LOTR in our childhood and fell in love with Middle Earth and its unfair to burn it down for failing to do that. Its just a good Tolkien show.",alexanderlunenborg,8,0.3125,Yes,The Great Wave,5,16
Hopeful,"First two episodes are good. On a technical aspect, it is quality. A lot of convenient things happen in both episodes, but Im not gonna complain much about that. Budget is ironically the best thing about the show. You can tell every shot doesnt waste anything. Also liking the story arc of the elf archer that acts like a side mission in a videogame. In conclusion, the show does a good job of balancing like 5 story arcs. Some arcs are more boring than others, but they are entertaining in the grand scheme of things. Morfydd Clark as Galadriel is definitely the standout from the cast and her story proves to be the most important of the bunch while the other 4 or so help the main story in ways we are yet to see. Just hopeful that the season gets better as it goes on.",TheOne746,8,0.5419161676646707,No,Adrift,181,334
People are expecting P. Jackson world/vibe.. or whatever,"Im a huge LotR movies and lore.. Nothing can or will knock down the Peter Jacksons movies. Also I am a huge fan of Hobbit.Stop watching this show as Jacksons lore and star watching it as LotR/Tolkiens lore. Ever episode is getting better and better. For me 3rd episode was the best so far. Just thinking that finally we get to see the Great kingdom of Numenor??? Wow.. I watch this show as something new, something that uses little bit of everything yet it is show with its own agenda and own way of working the Tolkiens story. Set aside stupid things, what dialogue issues?? What Galadriel issues??? Story is getting better, Galadriel is in this show at least 2000yrs younger then in LotR and Hobbit.. Love the way her story is going.It is a slow burn but a beautiful one, one that will show us finally the stories, cities, characters, battles and many other things that we wished for since we read the first book or saw the first LotR movie.All 3 episodes - I give 7.5
3rd episode - I give 8.5.",boleoo,8,1.0,No,Adar,1,1
Steady pace but too steady,"I think what was done well in the first two episodes continues to be done well. I appreciate the deeper lore aspects they talk about even if the average viewer doesnt get it, its still gorgeous to look at, the actors continue to be quality.However I think the plot needs to start moving along more. For a die hard fan theyll hang onto the world building. For a casual viewer theyll get bored. The stranger plot is moving at a snails pace and doesnt seem connected to the greater plot. That time wouldve been better spent with Celebrimbor as he directly is tied to the titular theme of the show. The Harfoots are well done and entertaining in their own right, but its just too early in the show to get bogged down in a slow moving plot when the audience still hasnt been introduced to any threat beyond Sauron existing *somewhere* . Without that plot moving faster, it seems as if their inclusion in the show is more of a weight than a wing. Its not their acting or dialogue , its just too unconnected and slow at this point.Theres also some very , lets say awkward, creative choices. The first being Galadriels slow motion scene on the horse. I hated that. Unflattering angle, scene went too long. If you want a hero rides horse across landscape scene watch Two Towers on the way to Edoras. The director really dropped the ball there. The second is the Warg , its not wrong per say just wasnt the type of design Id have picked. Lastly, too much slow mo in combat scenes. Let the fight play out, its reminding me of Michael Bay. The editor also needs to let the panning shots of the vistas last a little longer. No WCS use for a quick cut of a gorgeous shot then an elongated view of Galadriel on the horse.But ending on a good note : The Numenor plot with the humans and Halbrand is great. Halbrand 100% is sketchy and done well. Elendil might be the best actor of the series so far as well and I can buy him as a future king. The city itself looks the part as well. Arondirs plot , now being revealed as Mordor, takes on a whole new meaning.All in all, on its own the episode was satisfactory but not outstanding. The director and editor probably shouldnt be brought back and was carried by the material theyre working with. And the reveal of Adar next episode or so needs to be worth this long wait because even as a die hard fan I find myself wanting the plot to move more quickly and not spend so much time watching Harfoots hold a festival.",nateoak10,8,0.36538461538461536,Yes,Adar,19,52
Glorious visual realization of Numenor!,"I enjoyed this episode very much. Numenor was brought to life in glorious fashion. The new characters introduced are compelling, especially Elendil. Yes, the timeline of the second age is tightened significantly, but that is necessary in a TV or movie interpretation.Im really curious to see who Adar turns out to be. Is he actually Sauron or one of the dark lords captains. We know that Sauron appears in disguise to trick the Elves into forging the rings, so he will have to be revealed at some point.I continue to enjoy the Harfoots. Is the Stranger Gandalf or another wizard? Not sure at this point.The orcs are horrible as always. I much prefer the practical effects being used rather than CGI. It makes the world feel more real.Excited for next week!",julie-926,8,0.4230769230769231,Yes,Adar,11,26
Interesting episode!,"A new Ring of Power episode begins from the long-awaited Neominor land.Episode 2 ends with the appearance of the Neuminor ship, and at the beginning of Episode 3 we experience the simple joy of seeing what we have been waiting for, the beauty of Neuminor where the visual work is clearly shown.The creators of this series have continued to work. The story itself was less than previous episodes and more intense to reveal new characters who play important roles in the story.Things didnt go well in middle earth, and eventually Orcs appeared to us with good appearances, returning to the trilogys era and many questions after a somewhat interesting episode ended.No major changes in the aspects of Harvots , but knowing the reality of the magicians intentions, I dont know if he was the magician in the novel or some good magician in the series, but definitely to learn this we want at least two episodes or at the end of the next episode.",aboalhyjaa,8,0.39473684210526316,No,Adar,15,38
Great show!!!,"I cannot understand all the hate and negativity..
First i want to say i have watched all the Lord of the ring movies and the hobbits and i found them good, but not amazing. To my suprize i love so far the 3 first episodes of the show. I love the music, actors and the story so far.I will judge at the end what my overall rating will be but for now its been a 8/10. Cant wait to see more and i truly belive it will be very good.As for those giving it 1/10 rating.. i mean really? 1/10? That would mean everything is just pure trash.

Another Solid Entry.,"I hope this episode wins more over to the show, as I felt it really got things moving story wise. The visuals and music really whisk you away and immerse the viewer in this vibrant world. That is something to behold, even if you dont like the story.I enjoyed seeing Númenor, as well as other familiar characters from the history of Middle-Earth. The episode does a good job switching between storylines, and while there are a few moments where I thought it lagged or wasnt the best, it just delivers with each new scene.The Harfoots continue to be the heart of the story, and they very much have won me over with the character of Nori Brandyfoot. Shes a kind, sweet, and curious person who wants to do the right thing.There are some Orcs in this one, and I wont get into
spoilers, but the scenes surrounding them were great. I loved seeing practical Orcs again, and not the terrible CGI ones from the Hobbit films. Bravo to
The entire makeup and costume department. They most certainly will wins some awards for this.Overall, and exciting episode with some more great word-building and some tender heartfelt moments that really shine out and remind me why I love Tolkien and his world.",alasdairboswell,8,0.41044776119402987,No,Adar,55,134
"Big step up from the previous two episodes, lets see if it keeps improving","Synopsis. This episode start out very well from an visual point of view, however its not only that. Its an episode that makes you excited to come back next week.Analysis:
When you recreate something that has had enormous success in the past you will face criticism and you have to improve on what has been done in the past. Here the decor is a high step up from Peter Jackson. The central wharf of Númenor has been build according to Appendix A. And its mind-blowing. Absolutely well done.Onto the story:
Galadriel is better then the previous two episodes, but still kinda annoying. Elves can be warriors (think of Arwen), but Galadriel is a bit of an immature angry elf atm. She doesnt have the class and grace that one would associate with an elf. And whilst a female hero is fine for a fantasy series today, the Wolverine treatment she is getting here doesnt do it on screen, in these first three episodes. She is just angry... Halbrand is growing into his role. The halflings are also growing in both in relevance and the dialogue has improved. This is the first episodes where they seem to fit in.Dialogue, as just mentioned has improved from the previous two episodes. Although the captain with his kids sounded like it came of a wrong script, like a Disney movie set in 2010s, not Middle Earth universe. Its annoying coz its these kind of things that take you out of the world when watching. However I do trust this will improve as the season moves on. Or rather said lets hope that it will improve :-)Special effects, they are overall good, but one request to the production team is PLEASE no more Matrix moves. It just looks ridiculous.Fandom
To wrap this review up. It seem right to add a passage on where we are In the world today of reviews, YouTube and other social media. It can be hard to digest when people change something about Middle Earth, or arent faithful. However having now seen this third episode, it seems a good moment to take a break from what has come before. Some of the members of this fandom call this an easy cash grab, sell out and fan fiction. An tbh, that is unfair and incorrect I can now say. While liberties have been taken. Hundreds of people have worked on the project for years and whilst it certainly has it flaws. There is definitely a lot of care and interest to do it right been put into it.There might be some amongst us that are just rejecting the series, because they are unhappy that the rights to the full legendarium where not acquired, without even having watched the full three episodes. If you dont like it after three episodes its probably not for you, you gave it a try. And Its only fair to be disappointed and just move on to something else.After watching the trailers, many of us were rightfully unimpressed and concerned, but having now watched three episodes: Its actually ok.

Strongest episode so far,Lots of intensity and Numenor is absolutely fantastic. As a Tolkien super nerd this episode was full of references and fan service. Loved every second.Elendil was very good and Im so glad they name dropped Anarion instead of pretending he doesnt exist. The family dynamic between him and his kids is very good. Im very invested in the goings-on of Numenor.As always the cinematography was amazing but definitely wasnt the focus of this episode in comparison to 1 and 2. Consider this to be a more focused episode with the lens on the ground level and focused on the characters more than their environment.,austineusd,8,0.4861111111111111,Yes,Adar,70,144
Sometimes feels like an advert for middle-earth,"There are a lot of slow motion shots exploring the beauty of middle earth or the sets that have been built or just Galadriel horse riding. It feels like the show runners think they are selling holiday packages to middle earth. Almost every scene starts with a beauty shot, and the visual are stunning. So I guess I will take the deluxe package please.This episode was better. The story has finally started moving. Loved the scenes of Numenor, that story arc was awesome. Must admit, every time they cut to the harfoots, it was annoying. Im not enjoying watching these ancestors of hobbits.Its been a long, slow buildup for almost 3 episodes. Please, please let there be some payoffs soon. If they have a great action packed Episode 8, my rating will jump from 7 to 8 or even 9. I am hopeful.",bluenine-2,8,0.6131386861313869,No,Adar,84,137
IT IS NOT THAT BAD,"Ill admits first up that I had serious doubts about this series for a long time now. Ive also been a long time fan of Tolkiens literature so I knew I would have some issues with it but I think the efforts the cast &amp; crew have made here is admirable. This show actually feels like lots of love and devotion went into it.Anyway, the pros are the musical score (Howard Shore and Bear McReary have done a great job), the visual aspect and the Cinematography are top notch, and I mean it when I say that - it may be the most visually gorgeous TV series ever created. The lead actors have so far proven to be more than up for the job (especially those playing Galadriel, Elwood, Durin). Honestly, I didnt cringe nearly as hard as I thought I did at the sometimes overly-earnest Tolkien dialogue. Lines were delivered well and the overall cringe factor was far less than anticipated. The locations like Lindon, Khazad-Dum and even Valinor look great, costumes and weapons also look stunning for the most part.If there are any serious problems with this series, I did not pick up on them in the first two episodes. In fact, I only intended to watch the first 20 or so minutes to get a feel for it - I was that sure this series was going to bomb. But I ended up watching both episodes back to back because I was immersed and enthralled - the world of this series truly does feel like Tolkiens world for the most part.Any loyal fan should give this series an honest chance. Dont listen to toxic fans complainingthis show is too woke. Simply watch and make up your own mind (But make sure you can watch it in 4K and with good quality audio).",matp-47600,8,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,6

A visually stunning introduction to AMAZONS take on Tolkien.,"Let me start by stating my opinion on the controversy: Not everything can be presented in its canonically pure form. I wonder if some detractors have even read the entire tome of the trilogy. Its very unlike what can be mass marketed to a huge audience in 2022. I hate to break it to you, thats exactly whats intended for Rings of Power.Is that a bad thing? It depends on who you ask.I for one, am glad to see something that has potential to become new and engaging to an audience that was probably still in diapers when I first watched The Fellowship as a teenager in a movie theater.Its cinematically beautiful, and that helps a lot with pulling me into it. I think the dialogue and characters are passable, certainly not the scene stealers of the original trilogy.In conclusion, I think this is a great effort. Is a shame that to some, literary bias negates the cinematic stars it earned.",engo_,8,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,6
Nice trip back to Middle Earth :),"A solid setup episode, beautifully filmed using a lot of Peter Jackson style shots to give it a familiar feel.The budget for this show is clearly massive and it shows on screen. The setting feels as solid as the movies. Costumes are perfect and the music is excellent. I love that they havent resorted to repeating previously used melodies from the Jackson movies.The cast is solid and they play their characters seriously. The tone of the whole show is in line with the original lotr trilogy. A massive improvement over the slapstick tone of the hobbit movies.The fuss made about the ethnicity of particular characters is simply ridiculous, and this change just feels right, in such a setting.Overall this show has been a pleasant surprise, theres a lot for the fans here. Usually when a big company picks up a beloved IP they rarely handle it with the proper care (see star wars). So my expectations were pretty low going in. But it is very clear that in this case, middle earth has been handled with the care it deserves. And I look forward to seeing where the story goes from here.",james-87107,8,,No,A Shadow of the Past,0,0
Solid Introduction but yet not perfect,"As a fan of Tolkien, PJs trilogy movies and anything fantasy, I liked the first episode of ROP with the exception of few minor things, that could be done differently.I liked the references they made to First Age as a immediate prologue and considering they dont have presumably the rights on many FA stories, the show managed to elegantly portrait those moments, without infringement. The visuals and music were movie level and it felt as if Im really watching a PJs prequel to Middle Earth.The story and dialogues were as Tolkien as possible. There were few moments here and there that I did not liked as elves behave more like mortal men not real elves. Wished their wigs were more seamlessly done and convince me this is their natural hair, not a wig. They way it stands with the hide shaved sideburns, made me question it. Acting was convincing and adequate. There were few very memorable quotes. Overall it was a very good introductory episode.Most people find themselves confused and dissatisfied by Galadriels character in contrast with PJs Galadriel. But most people forget the progression and the story that made her the Galadriel we know in Third Age. This younger Galadriel shows sides we never knew til now about her. I totally understood where she came from and why she is the way she is now. And I liked it. After what happened to her, it is only natural to behave like this.",jogobvg,8,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,6
Exciting episode despite some mistakes.,"Special effects, photography, makeup and costume as usual was beautiful and amazing.I love the elf Arondir, with his skill in battle and some tactics. And this time we had no too much dialogues that is not bad but has been too much sometimes. For the next season I hope directors listen to us and avoid so many silly cliches.Some of the errors I mention in the title
(Spoilers alert!!!)The strategy of leaving the tower alone was nice, but is kind of weird they get back to the town and no orcs was found there. Previous episode was shown all the land was infected right? That was silly.Galadriel chasing the Aldar was doing right until Halbrand magically shows it self far below them that was really stupid and for me almost ruin the entire episode (I mean he was a very long distance behind Galadriel and suddenly he run faster than both and appears forward them).The broken cursed sword also was handled wrong. A weapon (or key) so dangerous was not check before by Galadiel or Halbrand when they took it from Aldar? I mean, to be inside that rag? Please!!!The elf Arondir fighting that giant orc, it was nice until the cliche of the love interest appears and save him with a single stroke. The fight choreography was impressive until it was ruin by that silly cliche.Looks like I didnt enjoy the episode, I did it, it was almost ruined but was fine. I was happy that people rated as more than 8.",faridalvarez-1,8,0.30303030303030304,Yes,Udûn,10,33
The Best Yet,"This is certainly ROPs strongest entry thus far. The battle was well choreographed, the acting strong, and for the first time the significance of all the long-winded exposition that dominated the previous episodes was felt. Nonetheless, there are still flaws. First and foremost, Bronwyn should have died. Her character has been contrived from the start. Why exactly is she like de facto queen of the Southlands? Second, how implausible that Galadriel/Halbrand wouldnt at least check that sack to see if the magical key was resident. Also, Isildur is a terrible character. Some flaws - such as Galadriels whole character - will be nigh insuperable moving forward, others are not inherent to the show. Focus more on Elrond and dwarves, less on silly side characters, and this show could be truly awesome.",tpmovies-13,8,0.2962962962962963,Yes,Udûn,8,27
Getting Better,"Well here we have it, this episode felt so much more like Lord of The Rings. Loved the hint towards a certain location (if you know you know).I will say it was visually stunning, the acting was better. And I love watching Isildur be the same one we see, very foolish and not very intelligent (very irrational and action first).Overall I think series wise it is very entertaining. Lore wise obviously its very liberal in its interpretation but thats alright its entertaining.Would recommend as one of the better shows available to watch right now. Better than marvel or Star Wars lol.Also to the people hating, I understand it but at the same Tolkien (token) I think its fun to see something come to life. Tolkien himself was always very humble so I think hed be blown away by the reverence of fandom, and interpretation that people are giving, especially to characters he wrote and loved!Lets keep it positive and enjoy the ride!",mohrbencarson,8,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,4,12
Finally a really good one,"This episode is just quality TV. Its what this show shouldve been from the start. Halfway through I realized why, it focuses on Numenor and Galadriel and it is easily the most interesting storyline. Everything is great, music, cinematography, stunt-work, acting. There are even a few plot twists. Cant wait to see where this show goes next. I wish earlier episodes were more condensed and to the point like this one. This show has a problem with too many characters. If it focused more on a handful of the main ones, it wouldve been much better. Honestly who even remembers the names of all the halflings ?",paulig-gr,8,0.2631578947368421,No,Udûn,5,19
"Best one so far, saved the series for me","I was just about to never watch this series again, but decided to give it another chance, and i must say this episode is really good. It surprised me a lot and in a good way. Finally many plot points come together and the show picks up the pace. The soundtrack is also amazing.But, apart from Elendil, all other characters are not appealing to me, so im constantly rooting for the orcs, i wish they kill most of the main characters so we can get rid of them for the rest of this season and the next one. My main hope is season 2 takes place several years after this season and they do a complete recast.",hugomf85,8,0.4,No,Udûn,2,5
They landed it,"Finally, dialogs that doesnt seems to have been written by corporative robots. We started to care about some characters that needed much more screen time.This last episode give me hope for the next seasons because this one was a snooze fest that care more about checking boxes than developing characters. Finally, we have some writing that actually mean something aside from pretty quotes and advance a global narrative.I dont care much about the chronological adaption. Yes, they squeeze 2000 years (ish) into one generation. But i think, it was necessary. Either that or kill every mortal each episode with a 100 year time jump. It would have been a nightmare, story wise.The last episode doesnt redeemed the season, wich, in my opinion, was very badly paced with a bad focus. Some scenes were cringe and badly acted and scripted. While the visuals are always extremly pleasing, I did not care about any character aside from Durin and hi wife.In this last episode, they had no choice to go full throttle, overcompensating perhaps for lack of rythm of the season.One scene still drag for way too long and again, focused on the wrong characters.I am hopefull for season 2. But please, kick the corporate boomer out of the writting room.",kyrross,8,0.48,No,Alloyed,84,175
"All in all, pretty decent","The episode ties everything together nicely. The Halbrand reveal was well done after the little twist trown in there regarding the Stranger. The overly long farewell scene of Nori was a bit tedious but then again, it was a bit of a nod to the end of the original trilogy where there is scene after scene of goodbyes. Elrond was very good, especially at the end. He was clearly torn between the situation regarding Halbrand and the beauty of the 3 rings now completed.Now lets adres the elephant in the room. I think all the hate the show is getting is undeserved for the most part, and more caused by YouTubers looking for views and therefore revenue by creating a controversy. Tolkiens work is of course as no other suited for this. A lot of people grew up watching the movies and the IP is close to their heart. What most perhaps do not understand that this special feeling of seeing Lord of the Rings for the first time all those years ago is just something that was an unique experience. Its like going to Disneyland for the first time as a kid with your parents and just have the best day ever. That feeling is just special and going back to Disneyland later in life will just no be the same. Perhaps too many have hoped that this show would somehow bring that magic back, and many influencers saw an opportunity to monetize this nostalgia.Watching it was entertaining for the most part. I rate it obviously below the original trilogy but I think the show was actually better done than The Hobbit movies. I think it respected the original lore enough. Obviously it took some liberties with timelines but this was to be able to tell the different stories that eventually lead to the events in Lord of the Rings at the same time. They sort of had to do this because its story is of course puzzeled together from mulitple works of Tolkien. All in all, pretty good. Dont let others put you off and tell you what you should or should not like and try to make up your own opinion. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings and are interested about what went on before, I absolutely recommend this show. Solid story, interesting characters and great visuals. Not the masterpiece we hoped for but still very much worth a watch.",alexanderlunenborg,8,0.5,Yes,Alloyed,5,10
Yeah great,"Yes that was great. Just have to wait 2 years until the next one... it hardly seems worth it too me. Having to wait all this time after having to wait a week between each episode with not much happening when the episode finally came out. I wouldnt mind if it was exciting but its a very slow burner, dull in places and shockingly written in terms of script and dialog. However the acting is decent and the show has begun to pick up. I hope it continues to do so however this show is supposed to be 5 seasons long, taking almost 10 years to complete. I have a feeling most of its viewers will be dead before its finished.Overall a decent but anticlimactic ending 8.0/10 from me.",samtimoney-79758,8,0.3191489361702128,No,Alloyed,15,47
Show is showing promise,"The show ended with some surprising revelations. Sauron is revealed, which I did not see coming. This season has developed lead characters well. Itll be good to see how they take the show forward in next season.The last episode did not feature some main characters, which seemed a bit odd. I would have expected to see each leading character appear in the last episode with their own closing to the season.The last episode ends with a song about rings. Only three rings forged so far. Dwarves and men still have to get their rings, with the last one for Sauron. Thats a lot of promise for viewers in upcoming seasons. Cant wait.Overall entertaining season.

A Long-Expected Party,"Honestly, I feel like Ive been away from family members for a really long time and now weve all met up and are just picking up where we left off, lol!I had my apprehensions, but The Rings of Power is a fresh, gripping and respectful new addition to the LOTR franchise and one Im sure the Professor would be extremely proud of. Beautiful visuals, mostly decent acting (Lenny Henry is a terrible actor!), a gripping plot, compelling characters (Morfydd Clark does a beautiful job of portraying a young Galadriel and I cant wait to see where her journey takes her!) and a poetical script that couldve been written by Tolkien himself! For me, it will always be impossible to recapture the magic of the great Peter Jacksons original movies but this opening instalment has done a pretty good job!A great start. Wether itll maintain that level of quality as the show goes on remains to be seen, but the future, like the sun-kissed shores of magical Valinor, looks bright. I look forward to reviewing the rest of this show...",Mohican15,8,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,6
Good episode,"The emergence and character development of Gandalf and sauron was good in this episode, the display of the rings was also amazing.also the story of the making of the rings, gold silver and mithril, was a pretty good choice. The acting and image quality, the cinematography are already excellent, the only problem throughout the series was the shortcomings in the script and the moment incompatibility with Tolkien, however, they completed some story development in this episode............................................................................................................................",kimyager-79936,8,0.2608695652173913,Yes,Alloyed,6,23
"When in doubt, Eleanor, always listen to your nose","You can hate this tv-show claiming that the plot is weak, dialogues are poorly written and actors play unprofessional. It can be said that everything was much better under Peter Jacksons hand. But we live in a world where the Lord of the Rings trilogy has already been beautifully filmed (and I hope no one will think of making a remake). And the Rings of Power is a product that should be treated separately. I wish this tv-show was similar to Lord of the Rings, but its different and I accept that fact. There are gaps, there are weaknesses, but we all set the bar too high and I would like to add a positive comment.I wanted this tv-show to remember some nostalgic notes of the Lord of the Rings adventure and understand that you shouldnt judge the wrapper by just the first couple of episodes. Yes, the beginning of this series may have been promising, raw and uncertain, but the spirit of Tolkien can be felt somewhere deep in the story.On last episode we saw a twist, an unexpected turn of events, and most importantly, with the Magician and Nori I remembered what made me fall in love with the story of the Mediterranean - faith in light, in friendship and the strength with which obstacles are overcome, to remember that if we didnt go away, we would never learn anything new . That flavor of magic is still flying in the Rings of Power and Im ready to give the second chance to a next season and believe in the magical story for which (lets be honest) weve all been waiting for so long.",ValDudka,8,0.2608695652173913,Yes,Alloyed,6,23
"Good, but still improvements needed!","With the season coming to a close, on the whole its been very average, the production is fantastic but the writing is very lazy. Episodes 1-5 were so poor its unreal, 6 was good and 7 was another dull filler. Episode 8 is good for what it is, but again there are too many lazy scenes:1. The Stranger all of a sudden becomes fluent in English after struggling to utter words throughout the whole season, he is casually having full on conversations with Nori.2. Why does Halbrand keep his human form once Galadriel finds out he is Sauron and then all of a sudden he has teleported to Mordor, casually strolling into Mordor with a Mancunian accent.3. What is slim shady actually supposed to be? A Nazgul? How so if the 9 rings havent even been forged! Another missing story line, they lost to the Harfoots ffs.Thats about it, for the negatives, but there were also a lot of positives especially in regards to production, the scenes of the rings forging etc was great.Overall I just feel this season has been really a filler, aside from Episodes 6 and 8 the rest have been really poor, when you decide to do an 8 episode season, you really have to make it stick with the audience. RoP can still rescue this in S2, but it needs to avoid all filler episodes and go straight into engaging content!",dannyh-56180,8,0.2777777777777778,Yes,Alloyed,5,18
Questions answered,"This episode along with episode 6 Udun makes me still keep watching the series. I finally got the real lord of the rings vibe I have been waiting for. It took a while for me to get connected and understand the characters, but this episode delivers and gives more character development to Galadriel, Elrond and Celebrimbor. It was a bit obvious that the stranger would become one of the Istari and that Halbrand might be Sauron (in my opinion), but still they managed to portray it satasfactory. I really look forward seeing Charlie Vickers (Halbrand) portray Sauron. There are still some questions that remain, like will those mystic people become the ring wraiths, is the stranger now really Gandalf (as his quotes are suggesting: When in doubt, follow your nose) and will we see the creation of the rings for the dwarves and men and of course the one ring in the next season?",boonstrabeau,8,0.2777777777777778,Yes,Alloyed,5,18
Im LIVID - but should I be? Great Episode however,"***SPOILER WARNING***
Great episode with a nice little twist with Sauron, however, I will say this: If The Stranger turns out to be (as its not actually stated, but rather implied) none other than Gandalf The Grey, I will never watch another episode again! May not mean all that much to Amazon, but there can only be one Gandalf - the great Sir Ian McKellen!!He has specifically stated that he would return as our favourite wizard. He played the role in 6 LOTR movies and Amazon want to stray from the formula? Im pi$$ed off. Again, he may not necessarily be Gandalf as there were 5 Istari sent to Middle Earth of stop the rise of Sauron. It could be a ploy to throw us off the scent, considering the resemblance is uncanny... I really hope he doesnt turn out to be Gandalf! :(",oreskid,8,0.2777777777777778,Yes,Alloyed,5,18
A spiteful audience,"Amazon was wrong, wrong in thinking making the show family friendly to appeal to a younger audience. Making it light weight, stunningly beautiful and rushed dialog.This concept wouldve worked on any fantasy show, as long as it wouldnt have such a rotten core.LOTR viewers are remnants of old, a generation that was strong 20 years ago, now longs like a Gollum for reliving their glory days when the original 3 movies came out. Spiteful beings, ready to destroy any show that attempts to touch their beloved ring now ensures newer generations will never have the same chance as they do to enjoy the world Tolkien created.Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, dont we consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if were partisans of liberty, then its our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!The gollum doesnt want to share, doesnt want other generations to have the same excitement as they had when they were young, they dont want to escape into a fantasy, freely given to us, by the hard work of others, they want to poison and spoil this sage with their hasbeen opinion.If you cant escape in this fantasy, but only judge, you dont deserve to watch. If you take the light out of others eyes, that longingly enjoy these series, you advocate the oposite of what Tolkien wanted for his stories.",chrisboringlife,8,0.21212121212121213,No,Alloyed,7,33
Not without weaknesses but satisfying in the end,"...which is really the overall conclusion from the first season as well. The series leans towards good, but there are many things that simply could have been better. Focusing on the main storylines of this finale:<ul><li>I understand why a tv show would substitute the Annatar storyline for this alternative reason for the 3 rings of the elves - and to be fair it is played out very, very well. Halbrand makes a good Mairon (or however else you wish to call him). That said, I cannot quite accept that this silly we need shiny jewels to survive random, vague, generic fading was worth it - and it certainly does not help that the solution offered is, in no uncertain terms, homeopathy - hey what if instead of getting your hands on tonnes of mithril, you diluted a miniscule quantity of it in 3 rings, that should be enough right? Please.</li></ul><ul><li>Obvious Gandalf was obvious from the start. The Harfoot storyline concludes well, if entirely expectedly, but we can but shake our heads at the doomed, misguided and entirely unnecessary diversion attempt by the showrunners - not so much because absolutely no one believed Eminem and his crews claim that the stranger was Sauron, but because these 3 characters had in the end no purpose whatsoever, apart from an ill-fated 5 minute attempt to fool the audience. Much ado about nothing.</li></ul><ul><li>There is a question to be asked regarding the timeline - I am pretty sure the 3 rings of the elves should be the last ones to be made/handed out before the One, but ok, thats minor. What remains major in my mind, and I know it is not literally a major thing, but I will never forgive it, is the Elves hair. Sorry, it remains unacceptable, horrific and ridiculous, and 8 episodes of looking at it did not quelch my hatred. It certainly did not help we had to suffer looking at Finrod again in this episode, looking like a 2022 footballer. I will here at the end sing the praises of Robert Aramayo for his performance as Elrond, but dammit he looks like he is going to turn around the corner and get bullied at a California school. As for Galadriel, I do not share the complaints about Morfydd Clark - she is doing the best she can, the problem is that the character might have just as well been Lagadriel, a random elf with connections in elven nobility - if we werent told this is Galadriel, it would simply not be obvious.</li></ul>In the end though, I want to see where the show goes from here and thats what makes the difference isnt it? I want to see Ar Pharazon marching on Valinor (though that will probably be at least 2 seasons later) and the origins of the Nazgul, I want to see more dwarves (of course, who doesnt) and in general, more actual rings of power. The show is certainly a better effort than the Wheel of Time (no idea how they managed to fumble that but anyway), but, and I KNOW there is no point in making comparisons, its not a contest and they are not the same thing, at the same time I cant help but point out there is also no comparison with the vastly superior House of the Dragon.",Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,8,0.21428571428571427,Yes,Alloyed,6,28
It restored my faith,"I thought that previous episodes were so-so, poorly written and/or written in such way to please some specific group of people. However, upon watching this episode I actually liked it.Previous episodes kept me at bay by never truly revealing what is happening and I kinda hated that to a degree. This episode however brought the full epicness of what exactly I wanted from the series and what I expected to happen.The plot twist of Halbrand being Sauron...I kinda suspected and I know it was hinted but I like the idea of him being Sauron as it brings us a whole new perspective on Sauron and who he was along with further developing his personality and him as a Dark Lord.I hope that what future holds will be much better then the the first season as Im now genuinely looking forward to it. :)",MCPaolaL,8,0.21052631578947367,Yes,Alloyed,4,19
Best ep so far,"Up until this episode, Rings of Power felt stilted and underwritten, mostly a dramatized timeline ticking boxes rather than an actual dramatic narrative.This ep felt much different. To start, it kept us focused on one geographic area and set of characters and because it kept turning the tables in unexpected ways.Finally, because it gave some actual characterization to Adar and some depth to the Orcs. And, more meaningfully, someone in Lord of the Rings finally calls out the fact that making and keeping the Orcs evil and expendable actually flattens the stakes in Lord of the Rings. That Lord of the Rings is a flat story if the evil characters have so little development.I do think that, going fwd, Rings of Power needs to restrain its prequel-ish instinct to put check boxes next to items its setting up for Lord of the Rings.That said, put a check box next to Mount Doom and Mordor, and expect check boxes soon for The Shire and the Riders of Rohan. Mount Doom and Mordor are spoilers, The Shire and Riders of Rohan are guesses.",darrenkaminsky,8,0.26666666666666666,Yes,Udûn,4,15
"Great Episode - Parents, Be Advised on Violence","This was an excellent episode of The Rings of Power, if not the best of the season. After a seemingly interminable number of table setting episodes, things finally start coming together between our various groups.Spoiler: No Harfoots or Elrond/Durin in this ep. Its just Numenorians and the people of the South.But what a great ride it is. Plenty of action and twists.I will issue a warning to parents: this is easily the most violent episode of the series thus far, and certainly more explicit in its violence than anything in the original LOTR trilogy. Lots of orc blood, dismemberment, etc. Its not Game of Throne or anything, but this is the same level of violence that garnered the extended edition of Battle of the Five Armies as an R rating, but certainly less cartoonish.My only other beef is it seems the entire conceit of what created Mt. Doom (and Mordor!) hinged on the lead characters not bothering to check that the package they retrieved from Adar was, in fact, the sword. It was untrue to the characters and done in service of the plot so wed get a big shocker in the final minutes.Still a great episode and fun to watch, but I was disappointed that the writers seemed to have to stretch credulity a smidgen to get to where they wanted to go.",LoveStallion,8,0.2222222222222222,Yes,Udûn,4,18
Pretty strong episode,"Finally some moments that really made me want to watch the episode again immediately after. Some very good character moments. We finally saw what we wish to see, a wise Galadriel. Even if it was just for a few moments. Loved the scenes between Isildur and Elendil. Adar is amazing as always. Arondir is amazing. The action was amazing, but I also hated how long we had to wait for it. The orcs are incredible, there were moments where I was lost in the moments because of how real they look. Seeing Orodruin aka Mount Doom erupt for the first time and create what will eventually become Mordor was something that I have always wanted to see on the big screen.

Best episode so far - its getting there,"Finally, we get some action. Of course, 5 episodes in before that happens says alot about how crummy the roll out of this series is.Best part about the episode was the total lack of the ewok harfeet. They drag down every episode and their absence was a breath of fresh air.Second best part was Arondir. Best character of the series. If you liked Legalos, youll like Arondir. The love story with Bronwyn is too forced imo. Arondir could do better and shes BORING. Come on writers, give Arondir someone worth of his character if youre going to make us watch his love life.And darn you writers, Im now officially liking Galadriel. After Ep1, I figured I would spend the series hating this character. But shes blossomed, especially in this episode. Keep it up!But whats with all the elf/human love going on here? Every elf is falling for a human. Galadriel, like Arondir, doesnt need some smelly human as a love interest. Maybe have Galadriel and Arondir hook up. That would be more interesting than Halbrand with Galadriel. Hopefully, they dont rush the whole Galadriel/Halbrand thing and its just a head fake.",andrewjackson-20974,8,0.25,No,Udûn,1,4
Would that it were original,"Before watching the season finale, three clouds kept hanging in my mind whenever I thought about this show.Firstly, I promised myself if they are going to cook up some romance between Galadriel and Halbrand, Im going to give this show a 1/10 and never watch anything made by Amazon again. King or not, no human will every be worthy of Galadriel.Secondly, anyone familiar with Tolkiens works would know that Sauron cooperated with elves in the second age under friendly disguise, and secretly made his own ring. By the end of last episode, I was wondering how they are going to deal with that, with Galadriel so crazy about hunting down Sauron? Or are they cooking up something completely new that has nothing to do with Tolkiens works?Thirdly, why the hell are there so many Hobbits in this show??? They are cute, but they really dont matter in the history of middle earth before a certain Bilbo Baggins unfortunately joined a dwarfs adventure.And really, really surprisingly, the season finale answered all my questions. Halbrand turns out to be Sauron, and did manage to learn something about ring-forging from Celebrimbor. The stranger, whom I always presumed to be Sauron, turns out to be Gandalf! Yes its still different from Tolkiens story, but after all exploring some history between Gandalf and the Hobbits is not as grave a crime as imposing romance between Galadriel and some random guy.If this were an original story, this episode would have been a perfect conclusion to a very epic season. Alas, its not. And one good finale is not enough to appease all the outrage that the previous episodes have incurred.Right now I only have two wished for the future of middle earth. In the following seasons of Rings of Power, I hope that they can stick to Tolkiens story. Just as House of the Dragon has proven, when the source material is so fantastic all you need to make a good TV adaptation is simply sticking to the script. And if they are ever going to adapt Silmarillion itself into a TV series, I just hope that they can learn from the devastating lesson of Rings of Power, and dont make the same mistake again by presuming that they can change Tolkiens story into something better.",GeraltTargaryen,8,0.1111111111111111,Yes,Alloyed,1,9
A fitting end to a prequel of the rings of power,"This ending truly set up the next series with many of the foundations having been laid. I cannot wait until the next series is released as there are questions that are burning but also knowing where these will eventually end but i need to know what the journey of those stories are.The eventual reveals of 2 of the main questions that were burning were the true nature of Hillebrand and the stranger. After the first few episodes of the series it was obvious that he was going to be Sauron, which in comparison of the statue the masked version had in the prologue there needs to be a lot of building to be able to get him back to his full power. Violence and anger is certainly there but size and the magical side is certainly not. From much of the Hobbit movies its stated that he is a human necromancer before his return in the third age. Get me to the point where the one ring can be forged and i will have no complaints. The next one is the Stranger which is really hope isnt out favorite wandering wizard but actually his master Saruman. From the lore of the wizards this seems to be a passage of the wizards going through each of the stages until they find their place in middle earth. He looks like Radagast, acts like Gandalf but has arrived around the time that the earliest and the wisest would have been in middle earth which would mean it could be Saruman. More than likely itll be Gandalf before he becomes the grey, just like i said before i hope that the wizards have to be Nature nurturing first then reborn to caring for the little folk, no idea what the blues do and then becoming the greatest and wisest as Gandalf calls Saruman.The forging of the 3 elven rings is very interesting to change from lore as we know it. Technically yes Sauron did create the rings of the elves as he was able to provide the missing link of to be able to stretch the Mithril out across 3 rings. If the darkness is apart of the Mithril there is certainly a possibility that this can be controlled.Overall the ending is just s stepping stone to Sauron taking his throne in Mordor and with the ending showing Durians Bain could we see the fall of Moria by the end of season 2.",ha77y73ad97,8,0.2,Yes,Alloyed,1,5
Alloyed,"The journey of this show has been interesting. Amazon had to go through a lot of public backlash due to circumstances outside of their power (no pun intended). Personally, this show has worked for me. Ive found every episode to be an intriguing ride and it seems like they were setting up for something very fascinating to take place in the upcoming second season (whenever we may get it). The world of Tolkien is filled with lore and theyre obviously going to make their own. So the finale was a lot of what we had expected, and some things that werent, which is a good thing.If this show hasnt worked for you, I doubt that theres a lot in this finale that will convince you to change your mind. It doesnt feature a whole lot of stuff that we didnt expect to happen. However, as someone who has been a big fan of this show, I found the finale to be a satisfying conclusion to a glorious return to the world of Middle-earth. Its clear that they were leading up to a moment in time that would decide the future of this show, and while they leave the door wide open for the next season, theres clearly a finality to this. It puts the characters on new paths, but also makes it possible for you to jump off here if youre not further interested. Thats a good thing. Now, for the episode itself, it featured the reveal of Halbrands true identity, which I consider a high point, and not only because I predicted it from very early on, but because it was handled with a lot of care and finesse. Its certainly a shattering revelation to Galadriel and will form her quest for revenge coming up. There is a cool action sequence that sheds some light on the Stranger, but well have to wait for more on him to come. The visuals are still gorgeous as ever, and the scope of the show keeps expanding. Im sure well visit some new and interesting worlds in the coming seasons, and hopefully, well get to see some more giant and majestic battles.With Alloyed, the show has put a cap on its first season, but has left the door wide open for whatever the future may hold. It was a satisfying conclusion to a season that Ive loved, and an episode that brings all the magic of Tolkiens world while still doing things to make it their own.",lassegalsgaard,8,0.16666666666666666,Yes,Alloyed,4,24
Finally something happened!,"Not much more to say than that really, but if you want to get down to the nitty gritty, the way this episode actually improved upon the meh quality of predecessors was by focusing on the most interesting storyline, having a lot of actually decent action, and bringing together two different storylines, resulting in a more cohesive and engaging episode. A distinct lack of harfoots or elf/dwarf shenanigans helped though, making me wonder even more why i need to care about them.Acting was also better in the episode as a whole I thought. Some characters have been strong throughout in this regard, but i found Galadriel especially to be a lot less insufferable as in previous installments. Also Adar carried all the scenes in which he was present.The ending was a bit of a WTF moment however, and left me with a bit of a whut expression. Interested to see where it goes from this point however, and the improved writing, action, and acting all give me great hope for the coming episodes.",thaginganinja,8,0.4338235294117647,Yes,Udûn,59,136

I think this season whould have needed, only 2 not 4, which is way too much.I am still not sure where the story is heading as we have not seen any rings yet, inspite of the fact the series is called rings of power.2 episodes left of this season, I really hope the mystery box characters will be all revealed, at least...",gerger-02015,8,0.455,No,Udûn,91,200

As a result, the narrative suddenly flows.This episode has achieved in narrative progression what half the damned season wasted in its runtime. Why had this series wasted so much time on select characters essentially being macguffins themselves? All that investment felt pointless.For such an expensive television series with so much preparation and talent involved in the production, one would expect a thoroughly planned out story. Two steps backward then one step forward; with no time to spare.

It plunges you right into the story, and the pacing is very much improved over last weeks. The hour flew by!The characters finally get some much needed development, and some levity. Really thought everyone got a chance to shine, even Isildur, who
I havent particularly cared for in this show. The story is moved in directions I cannot wait to see continued next week.The tone of the episode is preparing for war on all
sides, and you really feel that. The exciting moments are well balanced with the regal and dialogue heavy scenes, but they dont go on for too long, which was very refreshing. Before you know it, youre onto a new scene.Overall, its fantastic from start to finish. Pacing is improved, characters are explored, and themes of deceit and staying true to youre oaths and friendships are explored.",alasdairboswell,8,0.28368794326241137,No,Partings,80,282
"Good introduction,","If at times boring. Look, I get that the Tolkien estate did not grant all of the rights to the LOTR lore and they had to use what was available (as far as Ive heard, the appendices in the end of LOTR books, which is... yeah... I know), and perhaps they should have re-thought everything. But judging this as an interpretation or fan-fiction as a whole. Id say its off to a good start.The plot: so Morgot was defeated by the ancient Elven Lords, but his servant, Sauron, killed off one of the main protagonists (Galadriele) brother and Galadriel vowed to destroy Sauron even if it takes her forever. So, flash-forward a couple of thousand years (Im asuming) in to the future, and we see Galadriele and company travelling the frozen lands in search for the remnants of Sauron. However, her company is not ecstatic, because the High King Gil-Galad had ordered to return many months ago. So, even when they find traces of Saurons influence, Galadriele is forced to return wherein Gil-Galad offers her a boon: passage to Valinor (the home-land of the elves), wherein she would dwell for all eternity in piece. But, being the main protagonist that she is, in the end, she refuses to cross realms and jumps ship.Other plot introduces the viewers to Harfoots (ancestors of Hobbits). The two main protagonists of them, Nori and Poppy are like quasi-Frodo and Sam. One wants to go on adventures, and the other, because she is her friend, reluctantly accompanies her (Id wager in the later episodes), because shes afraid of her well-being.Also, there is another plot brewing, which, Id assume will connect with Galadrieles search for Sauron. Theres an elf called Arondir, who is a member of a watch group tasked to keep an eye on the... Id guess decendants of the Numenorians who followed Morgot? Anyways, over the years, he ends up fancying a human woman (so, a possible love-plot line), but is soon introduced with a possible dark evil influence plot-line in the terms of something is poisoning the land from the East. So, he sets off to investigate.And, theres a fourth plot-line wherein Gil-Galad tasks Elrond to aid Lord Celebrimbor in his task of constructing a forge.Are they all following the books to a letter? From what I remember: no, to a big hell no. BUT, as a its own (fan-fiction) story, its all right. It has room for improvement, especially in the dialogue sections, because sometimes you think: What? For example, when Galadrieles companions say that they have exceeded the kings orders for months now, but they are still willing to go with her. But as soon as they find the mark of Sauron, they are like: Well, no, we cannot go any further, Galadriele. The kings orders were clear. We have to go back, despite Sauron still living.+ Locations

I like where this is heading.,"Im enjoying the character development these last episodes. Im looking past the actors and finding the characters beginnings.I cant wait to find out who the Stranger is. I wanted to say Gandalf but after this episode, possibly Sauron. The white haired trio, supporters.I can see where the mistrust between Elf and Dwarf begins and Elrond is stuck in the middle.Galadriel comes across as egocentric, and superior. Shes amongst humans and elfs who wont listen to the signs. But you see the leader were introduced to in LOTR.All these others are just whinging because they think the lore is being bastardized.

Fascination For Days,"A compelling follow-up to what came before in the Rings of Power series, episode 5 took on new life as it exposed lingering secrets and explored elusive mysteries.Great work on direction by Wayne Che Yip, and superb screenplay by Justin Doble. I have covered more details in previous reviews, so I shall keep it crisp this time round. Outstanding work all round by the VFX, hair-makeup, costume, music, cinematography, and editing crews, not to forget production design, set decoration, and stunts.The stranger, played by Daniel Weyman, was noteworthy. Nori Brandyfoot, played by Markella Kavenagh, was great. Poppy Proudfellow, played by Megan Richards, was amazing. Adar (non-canonical character), played by Joseph Mawle, was good. Bronwyn (non-canonical character), played by Nazanin Boniadi, was also good. Arondir (non-canonical character), played by Ismael Cruz Cordova, was great.Rowan (non-canonical character), played by Ian Blackburn, was amazing. Waldreg (non-canonical character), played by Geoff Morrell, was riveting. Isildur, played by Maxim Baldry, was interesting. Elendil (Capt.), played by Lloyd Owen, was great. Pharazôn, played by Trystan Gravelle, was quite good. Queen Regent Míriel, played by Cynthia Addai-Robinson, was enthralling.Galadirel, played by Morfydd Clark, was splendid. Halbrand (non-canonical character), played by Charlie Vickers, was great. Kemen (non-canonical character), played by Leon Wadham, was intriguing. Eärien (non-canonical character), played by Ema Horvath, was good.Sadoc Burrows (non-canonical character), played by Lenny Henry, was quite good. Malva, played by Thusitha Jayasundera, was great. Elrond, played by Robert Aramayo, was memorable. Prince Durin IV, played by Owain Arthur, was outstanding. High King Gil-galad, played by Benjamin Walker, was good. Celebrimbor, played by Charles Edwards, was also good. Valandil (non-canonical character), played by Alex Tarrant, was great.All other cast and crew did great work in Rings Of Power episode 5 Partings, now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.I liked that tiny detail about the stranger - whom I believe is Gandalf - pushing a Harfoot cart and then ages later, that same Gandalf will be riding into the Shire on his own horse-drawn cart. That, my friends, is what they call a tribute. *sigh* Its the little things... Gandalf himself remains unconfirmed as a character, but I started to see signs of him potentially being Saruman (!) instead. This episode played plenty of Two Towers tunes for me not to care about that possibility.Some intriguing reveals also took place around the white-robed mystics, particularly the one several fans thought was young Sauron. It turned out, the lead mystic was a woman, and so were her companions, a warrior and an aide. The Dweller, played by Bridie Sisson, was captivating in the role. She created yet another ominous thread of mystery for the show going forward. Some interesting sequences around Adar and the orcs added to the wonder in this episode.Poppy Proudfellows rendition of The Wandering Day song brought back some good old Tolkien vibes. My playlist has the song on loop now. Bear McCreary never ceases to impress. Not all those who wander are lost.The previous episode already hinted at a Helms Deep style battle to come, and this epi delivered a small portion of that promise. I am not yet certain if the coming battle will be on a scale lesser or grander than the face-off in Peter Jacksons The Two Towers. The tower in question was Ostirith - located in the eastern foothills of the Ephel Dúath. After Sauron will be done using it, much later in the fictional timeline, the place will become Cirith Ungol - near Minas Morgul, and a not-so-friendly neighbourhood spider named Shelob.I liked how they captured Mithrils very own origin story. But this was not in keeping with what J. R. R. Tolkien envisioned for the legendary ore. In fact, Mithril was a Númenorean staple more than anything strictly Dwarven-implemented. Graceful though the rewrite was, and visually captivating, I did not appreciate the heavy-handed deviation for numerous reasons.They connected the originally non-existent Song of the Roots of Hithaeglir (Tolkien had no such tale) with the light of the lost Silmaril, which to hear Gil-galad (of all Elves) say it was a thing yet to be found. In truth, the Rings of Power timeline will have already seen all three Silmarils in mindful existence. The foreshadowing of the much-awaited Balrog was the best part of this almost anti-Tolkien take on his rich and intricate histories of Middle-Earth, and beyond.Amazon managed to fit it altogether into their ongoing narrative, so I cant really complain. All in all, episode 5 of Rings Of Power was impressive and regaling. It captured even more nuances of the characters (canonical and otherwise) and locations that fans have come to admire about this franchise, and the show itself.The unthinkable use of that broken sword (rather, tool) of Sauron - the one Theo kept hidden for a while - the very sword being revealed to have played a sorcerous part in enslaving the Southlands folk to the Dark Lords will... Galadriel in full battle armour... Isildur and Elendil on their way to unwittingly fulfill their parts in the One-Ring-legacy... The Elves and Dwarves getting closer to creating a major inter-racial milestone, with Mithril possibly creating a strong bridge and bond between their people... Númenorean ships (those design masterpieces) going to Middle-Earth to address the threat in the Southlands - someone is going to jump out of one of those ships in classic Aragorn style, I can feel it...These, and sundry notable themes and throwbacks, enriched and enlivened the fifth episode in the Rings of Power Amazon series. And I am now sat looking at the weekend as if they are weekdays. Next Friday is taking longer to arrive than the Harfoots to their new home.",BijeshNagesh,8,0.2903225806451613,No,Partings,9,31
A grand start.,"Havent written a review in some time, but the overreacting and negative reviews for this have compelled me to write.This was a beautiful opening episode. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous, and the visuals for the locations of Tolkiens world were jaw dropping. You really feel like youre back in Middle Earth again.Dialogue was important for me, as the conversations between characters is what makes Tolkiens work so iconic. Personally, I thought they nailed the dialogue for the most part. There were a few lines that felt a bit modernized and out of place, but overall, it sounded very much like Tolkien.The acting from the cast was really solid, especially. Morfydd Clark as Galadriel. She stole the show for me, and really did a fabulous job.This show has one task to win me over; feel like Middle Earth and do justice to the source material. It does that. Are there going to be embellishments? Of course! Its based on the works of Tolkien. Its an adaptation. The music was wonderful, the scope and scale was something to truly behold. Cant wait to see where things go.",alasdairboswell,8,0.5714285714285714,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,7
I actually liked it.,"I am not a paid pen for Amazon, or primevideo, or IMDB. In fact, IMDB has deleted - at least - 10 of my reviews so far, including Star Wars and more. So...First things first, I am a normie, which means I have not read the books, nor will I ever read those... writings. That said, I do not also care what Tolkien envisioned in his time which was the natural outcome of white supremacy and racism. More importantly, I do not give a flying fudge about the lore or fiction of the Middle Earth as it is just a biased propaganda for white europeans.So, I will start with surprising disappointment the various quality of VFX. One scene it is perfect; 3 seconds later, it is just a green screen.Galadriel is as pretensious as you have all expected. However, this is a fantasy, so what else could you expect for fs sake?!! I mean, you are figthing and you have long hair?! Anyone whos ever been in a fight would tell you, youd be batterred down to death if you have long hair. And if you are not aware of this fact, it means youve never been in a fight. EVER.The arrogance of Galadriel is much like that of any character in Lord of the Rings, by the way. So shut up, please.Photography and production quality (except for those that look like fake as hell) are surprisingly sufficient and good, a word which I do not like to use. Especially those wide angles introducing the dramatic setting (geographical places). I mean, those are some high-grade VFX.However, the sword jump is as fake as the VFX of Hobbit. I mean, have you ever seen somebody jump?! Editing as well, by the way.And producers have no idea of the concept of chain of command, either. And the non-Hpbbits look as good as the real hobbits. For example, (26:10) he is 100% correct.Markella Kavenagh (Nori Brandyfoot) is apparently talented. She does everything she can to sell the story, unlike the lot we see in this first episode. I hope her character has a decent development throughout the show.One thing, though, I do not understand: why do Elves (Elfs?) have veils?!!!! I mean, why on the middle earth?!",nakrugt,8,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,5,10
I hope the writing improves because the cast and production values are great,"Jacksons LOTR and Hobbit films are among my favorite films. I think they are very grand and transports the viewer into a feigned history. I have tried to avoid all information about this show before watching it. I knew that it was set in the 2nd age and that Jackson wasnt really involved. I was surprised how well visually the show and the Jackson films fit together. The show has its own vibe and design sense but it clearly built on the bones of the Jackson films. It does feel like these locations and sets will devolve into the locales we see in the LOTR/Hobbit series. So while this episode isnt as grand as the films it does do the one thing that hoped it would. It brings middle-earth back to life.I like the cast they got. Elrond, Galadriel. And Nori are appealing characters and the new actors are all good fits. Importantly the cast has chemistry with each other. And they are buying into the world enough to sell the fantasy.But I have two big issues with the writing. The series is presuming that you have read up on Tolkien-there is a *ton* of lore that is unexplained in this episode. Ive read basically everything Tolkien wrote-not just the LOTR-and I had to look some stuff up to piece the storyline together. I think causal fans will find parts of the episode impenetrable. The exposition of the first episode makes it a little dramatically flat.My second writing issue is the series has been-seemingly-influenced by Game of Thrones to make it grittier. There is a more realpolitik vibe to the proceedings than Jacksons films. And the language of the dialog doesnt have the grace of the Jackson films at least attempted. The series appears unwilling to use elvish all that much. Theres a bluntness to the dialog that I find off-putting in context. Likewise the characters, esp. Elves, have been rendered more petty and common than high fantasy requires.",CubsandCulture,8,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,8
Liked it better watching 5 & 6 back to back...,"This episode is building to episode 6, so a lot of exposition &amp; Ep 5 ends flat. But I waited to watch them together, it made me like Ep 5 a lot more, with only 10 min into Ep 6, I am glad I did.This show is dense in lore &amp; is building even the characters we know from Hobbit &amp; LOTR basically from scratch. Obviously, hundreds of years before the stories led by Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo, &amp; many others, all of the ones we know are completely different people/elves/hobbits/orcs/dwarves/etc. This show is beautiful &amp; crazy, I wish we were focused more on dwarves &amp; elves, but plenty of time to fix that.",notoriousvic-44206,8,0.0,No,Partings,0,7
The Galadriel Show?,"I have lots of good to say about these first few episodes. The music and scenery are 10+! Epic World-Building! But this is apparently going to be The Galadriel Show, and it is a shame because she is such a lightweight actor. Why spend billions on a show but then hire a cast of 1000s of unknowns?! Im a mother with a daughter and Im ALL FOR strong female characters, and there is plenty of precedent in the Tolkien Books and the P. J. movies, but this Galadriel actor is just not believable. I had to LOL at her fighting the Snow Troll all alone while the men watched. Fortunately, the other acting is tremendous, especially Arondir and Bronwyn!!! Unlike others, I will wait until the end of Season 1 to leave an overall rating for this show. So far, though, it has been enjoyable, and I look forward to the rest of the episodes!PS I have now watched the first 3 episodes, and I felt like Galadriels acting was somewhat improved in episode 3. But it still looks like The Galadriel Show...",jeersNcheers,8,0.5714285714285714,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,7
Interesting,"After i have finished now Episode 1 around 3 minutes ago, i have to say that for someone that has nothing to do with the World and works of this Universe. I liked it, it was good gave idiots like me a good start into the Series. The Costumes and the set pieces looked really awesome and the acting was quite descent even though one of the Characters gave me Neil Patrick Harris vibes, the score was very epic and some wide shots really looked beautiful. I really look forward into the Future of this work and i hope House of the Dragon gets a good competetor.The Episode was quite okay.

A pretty good opener,"Im not someone who has any desire to read Tolkien and I feel very meh about the LotR movies, so I watched this as an interested relative LotR newbie.The graphics and cinematography are stunning. Action wasnt too graphic and looked good for the most part. Theres a good opening monologue lore catch-up for non Tolkien fans. The characters are pretty interesting, Im invested in some of them already. The pacing was good but it dragged in places, the episode could have been shorter.There were a couple of plot holes and questionable script decisions that had me raising an eyebrow. Its got some eye roll worthy tropes, but since Tolkien basically invented the tropes I can forgive that. The brief bit of romance was cringe, I hated it. Hope it improves drastically.Tolkien fanatics will hate this but I really wasnt impressed at how blandly European the whole thing felt. Many of the sets could be from a medieval drama rather than fantasy, costume and set design feel lacking in culture and detail. If youre going to annoy the Tolkien stans by making changes to the source material, then you may as well add to the world building to make it more culturally rich. Take a leaf out of Wheel of Times book there. I was disappointed by the lack of diversity in this episode too.Overall I really liked it though and am looking forward to the rest of the series.",TheWheelWeaves,8,0.6666666666666666,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,6
"So much anticipation, does it live up to it? Mostly.","So the biggest TV show ever made (at least in terms of cost of rights and production) has finally landed. I have given myself a while to digest what I have seen in the first two episodes before writing this.Firstly, I am a big fan of the original source material, The Hobbit was the first book I bought with my own pocket money at age eight, by ten I had read and re-read it and LoTRs endlessly.Secondly, I am also a big fan of Peter Jacksons tireless work at adapting them into films (although the Hobbit unnecessary trilogy was slightly more annoying).So, this had a lot to live up to.For me it did, but not so much for others in my family. My wife and step-daughter both felt the first episode was quite tedious (even with the Snow Troll fight at the beginning). I actually enjoyed the slow pace and the sumptuous visuals.There is such a sense of World established here, just as Jackson managed in his impressive early 2000s films. Obviously much of the design choices, and even some of the scripting have a lot to thank him and his crew for.But this TV show is determined to be its own beast.I think it benefits greatly from the fact that it is drawing largely from sketchy history in the Appendices, there is so much more here that we dont know about than that which we already have knowledge of.It is possible to be grossly disappointed in an adaptation of a book when sections of your favourite parts are either excluded or radically changed.Coming in with only a vague memory of what was in the Appendices, I find myself willing to let it all be instead of picking it apart in minute detail as I was doing for both The Hobbit and LoTRs films.In other words, I dont think I have any preconceptions to spoil.Go into watching this with that kind of open mind, and I think you will love it.The second episode is a high 9 out of 10 as well, the trajectory seems very pleasing.Also, the problems some people seem to have with casting are absurd as far as I am concerned. Tolkien was basing his world on our planet, meaning that there would be just as vast a different array of races and Ethnicities as we have now.Just because he did not explicitly write it, doesnt mean it could not be. Also it is not like they are making such casting decisions with the big famous characters from the books, these are characters about which little was known.But also, at the end of the day, it is fantasy fiction! How can you moan about someones skin colour not being realistic when there are big dragons swooping about! Crazy.",medwards-85263,8,0.6666666666666666,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,6
Sets the tone right for the season,I always predicted this show will start by showing parts of 1st Age as a backflash in the 1st Episode (just like the original LOTR trilogy - where we started by getting a hint of War of the Last Alliance). And it did exactly that.One of the main problems in Peter Jacksons Hobbit trilogy (specially the last part - Battle of the Five Armies) was it lacked character building. The show has started by giving a clear sign - that they have learnt from those mistakes. Though that makes the 1st Episode a little slower in pace - but so was the Fellowship!Few of the other let downs in Hobbit trilogy was it always gave a feeling that the Dwarfs are having a fun-ride through the evil - few areas like the Goblin Cave / Bilbos Trolls etc made the enemies look like Cartoon villains - which wasnt the case for the original LOTR trilogy.Few of the scenes in this 1st Episode - clearly shows that the team isnt willing to let down - e.g. The mountain Troll scene.And then comes the highlights - a show becomes an EPIC when you have scenes which you would want to see again and again - looking for more details. This 1st Episode already has that for me! The scene where Galadriels team of Elf warriors reach the Utumno like evil fortress - we get a feeling like the Noldors flight in the winter storm - when the team struggles through the storm in the dark - and then the EPIC shot of the fortress suddenly showing up in between the lightnings - I can see this scene again and again.Its not Peter Jacksons work anymore - the show has already started leaving its own mark - were truly in the 2nd Age - A Shadow of the 1st Dark Lord Morgoth!The only reason I cannot give it 10 is the way it treated the Elfs - short hairs - I really cant buy this.They also dont sound like such a knowledgeable clan in some areas.But this is a marathon - so I do hope that the showrunners will correct those at some point.A must watch neverthless!,emailmonomoyghosh,8,0.625,No,A Shadow of the Past,5,8
"Great start, I love all the tidbits from the Silmarillion!","As a long time Tolkien fan I really enjoyed the first episode. It was slow but in a good way; introducing the characters and the world. I just loved the boat scene, with the ginger elf and what that implied!Next, the recap of the 1st Age. I love that it was left vague, and possible to match lore even though the show dont have the rights to the Silmarillion.Then we finally get to revisit Middle-earth! I love love love this!!

"Wow, that was slow, that was emotional.","I loved this slow-paced episode. After the fast-paced previous episode, we saw slow progress in the story, but some key concepts were introduced. This episode had a striking look. This episode was necessary to conclude the previous one and set a new stage for the upcoming events.Many people got used to complaining about how poor this series is. But let them not distract you from the really intriguing story that this is becoming. There was a clumsy beginning with lots of plot threads and many characters. Still, it seems that the viewer already has a decent recognition of who is who and what they are up to.This is a promising series. The last two episodes were top of the class. No wonder why the studio ordered the second season.",lkacz1,8,0.3,No,The Eye,18,60
"Come on, guys...","Reading through these reviews I get the feeling that Im the only one whos actually enjoying this show -___- Sure this episode wasnt the best episode but someone else said it, too . . . Its pretty typical in a series for there to be a slower episode after one thats stuffed full of action.That being said, I missed the part where Galadriel and Theo got separated from everyone else. It looks like they just wandered off into the smoke. That was a little confusing. But I will forgive it since a goddamn volcano just erupted and no one could see much.The second thing that bothered me was the balrog in Khazad-dûm. They make it seem like theyre going to awaken that MF in no time at all but dont they need time to like make some god damn mithril armor before that happens? Like according to the lore or whatever isnt there like 300-400 years of mining mithril and making badass armor and weapons before they awaken the Durins Bane ? Im just speculating cuz I havent seen episode 8 yet or anything but yeah they didnt need to show us the Balrog yet lol.Those two things aside I still really enjoyed this episode, just like all the other ones.

An actually good episode,"So far its the lowest rated episode, and I really cant see why. Till now the show has suffered from
1) too many storylines - slow pace
2) weird dialog
3) butchered lore
While the third problem is indeed still a problem, we have more storylines that are converging, and the dialog is definitely better than the stones look down Finrod thing. Also, Adar calling out Galadriel must have shook her as she finally appears to be closer to the wise being we knew, and the harfoots thankfully stop abandoning people to just die. For me at least there have not been painful to watch moments (painful as in what were they thinking when they wrote this bit? in this episode, which might actually be a first in the show.",mariamer,8,0.2127659574468085,Yes,The Eye,10,47
Dark. I love it,"Aftermath of the wonderful last episode. So the tone had to be darker. Burden is too much to handle on ones shoulder. Galadriel is showing a lot of promise. The high men are lost of moral. But they make do and kept going. For the harfoots, it shows Nori has a good heart. Even when they were left out of food, she offered an apple to the stanger. Says a lot about her. Even though we never doubted her. When she loses hope it is good to see harfoots showing their character. Stranger is getting interesting day by day. Also three evil characters, we have to keep an eye on them. For the front of dwarves, it is good to see prince Durin finally standing up to his father. The interesting charcters at the start have kept remaining interesting. Disa steals every scene she is in. My queen. Prince durin is filling the shoes of his name. Elrond is going steadfast. He sees way beyond. Finally the reveal at the end was worth it. Finally seeing him. Worth for the wait. Good going. Mordor is here.",moviesknight,8,0.23214285714285715,No,The Eye,13,56
Tolkein-ish and somehow reminded me of a big budget version of movie Willow,"So, this is a TV series commissioned by Amazon with the bulk of the story lifted from the vague appendices from the Lord of The Rings books. So lets just say that there quite a lot of room for interpretation and thats not a bad thing because most people havent read or know of the content in those appendices which is a great basis for a spoiler free experience. The acting is adequate, the costumes and visuals are stunning/beautiful, getting the pre-LOTR / The Hobbit era just right where everything seems just a tad more primitive than the settings for the books we all know and love. The first episode covers the usual drama tropes i.e. Defiance of authority and tradition, forbidden love, an unseen enemy / ominous threat, revenge and to be honest its handled quite well.Now for the loaded question and that is that some more cynical out there have complained that there are breaches in the canon and lore of Tolkein when it comes to the appearance and uniformity of groups of characters in this production; I for one dont mind this as that to me is almost incidental (hey they did it partly in The Witcher and we all loved that); for me what is important is the story, character (as in motivation and persona) and the dramatization.This production is not a Wheel of Time (awful as that was I gave up on it and could not continue) and watching the 1st episode has compelled me to watch more.Dont listen to the naysayers who wrote off this production before they saw it months ago, open your mind, sit back, relax and enjoy a wonderful fantasy adventure.",david-fernandez,8,0.4861111111111111,No,A Shadow of the Past,175,360
A solid start,"Overall a good start to the series, a good, solid episode that establishes the world (which is needed as the Middle Earth most know is completely different to this one set thousands of years before). The dialogue is fantastic and well written, if I was to be critical there is a bit too much r rolling when the elves speak but this is purely down to my own personal preference. The introduction to the characters was good, the establishment of the story was very good, as I was initially worried the writers would end up getting a bit too bogged down in exposition, but it was clear and concise without feeling like they were leaving anything out for the sake of ease. The costume design is utterly fantastic, and the world already feels lived inz Really happy with the show so far and hope it continues in this vein.",benfallon,9,1.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,2
An epic and promising beginnings,"The first episode provides a good overview and an exciting welcome to the second age of middle earth.New, interesting and likeable characters are introduced allowing a glimpse of this rich and colourful world.I am a big fan of Tolkiens middle earth and I think this episode is consistent with his writings. Also there is a fair amount of interpretation which is expected and again is very consistent and does not stray too far from Tolkien based on my memories of The Silmarillion which I read many years ago.The cinematography is first rate with grandiose setting and stunning/epic visuals. The music and production values are superlative.The episodes provides a promising beginning to the series story introducing key characters and developing the locations and the beginnings of the plot within this world.Overall an outstanding and epic beginning to this series.",jasonmcintyre-44398,9,1.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,2
"Excellent, as expected","The beginning of the long awaited series, as was expected of a story related to the Lord of the Rings masterpiece thrilogy and as a part of the magnificent world of Tolkien, was perfect.A balanced combination of mesmerising scenes and beautiful story telling which hooks you up to the screen and excites you to know the rest, this feature that made me want to watch all of the episodes that are yet to come was something I have been yearning for, for sometime now.In the episode there was room for showing and using elven magic, which an interesting feature.The length of each episode is another power point of this series which provides enthusiasts like with more content than other series.Thanks a lot, cant wait for the rest, high expectations.",hematmmh,9,1.0,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,2
Culmination,"For a series, the budget and quality of this episode was fantastic. After a long wait we receive an action packed, thrilling episode, that leaves me wanting to know what happens next. I enjoyed the previous episodes, because of all the mystery and plot gathering that guaranteed the last few episodes of the show would be entertaining. There is still a lot to happen and be explained and I truly hope the next episodes will be as good or better than this one.Everyone who was misled that the show is so bad that it is unwatchable, should definitely at least give it a chance. Its not a masterpiece but its certainly worthy of your time, especially if you are not so hellbent on an a priori expectation for the storyline.",bace_anti,9,0.4444444444444444,No,Udûn,4,9
A Shadow of the Past,"As much fun as it has been to revisit the realm of Westeros, this is the show that I have been dying to see, looking forward to the imminent return to Middle-earth and its creatures. A lot of fuzz has been made about the show and the liberties taken by Amazon, and I honestly couldnt care less as it seems like the same people who want to hate on anything, and would probably have hated on the films had social media been around back then. This first episode was an epic return to this world with new introductions to fascinating characters and a looming threat.With the great love I have for Tolkiens novels, I was ready for this to be a different tale than what he ever wrote. And while the show is definitely not a one-to-one adaptation of his stories, it feels like a piece of Tolkien writing. J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay definitely brought out the big guns and wrote to the strengths of the characters, coming up with a first episode that sets up this giant world with multiple characters that I am excited to follow over the next few weeks. The beginning was great and kinda jumped over what I thought the show was, but the fact that Im not sure what were going to see is actually what makes me even more excited to tune in every week. For all the pacing issues that this episode had been accused of, I saddled in for a long ride, but actually found it to be rather smoothe. Sure, there are certain scenes that could have been a little shorter, but they never bothered me as I was fascinated by all the conversations the characters had and the level of detail the writers put into the language. The Elves take up a big part of this episode, but the Harfoots get some screen time and they are adorable. Im glad that Morfydd Clark is getting a big role that people will see, because she is a massive talent and someone to look out for. She did great as Galadriel and is a promising lead for this.A Shadow of the Past is a promising start to this show and sets the stage for whatevers to come and Im here for it. All the characters feel like Tolkien creations and the world seems as ripe for stories as it did when Peter Jacksons films came out, so Im very happy right now.",lassegalsgaard,9,0.390625,No,A Shadow of the Past,150,384
An Amazingly Impressive Start,"The emotional sincerity, ethereal atmosphere, and pure fantasy excitement of Jacksons The Lord of the Rings trilogy is perfectly captured here. The characters are quickly likeable, the visuals and special-effects are stunning (completely destroying the line between film &amp; TV production), the dialogue is poetic, and overall, its an incredibly tight script that establishes the world, story and characters in a concise and engaging manner. Its such a joy to be back in Middle-Earth, guided by hands that are clearly pouring a lot of care and heart into this project. I cant wait to see where this show goes.",amongpixels,9,0.4111969111969112,No,A Shadow of the Past,213,518
Origins of Mordor,"Bronwyn and Arondir help lead the people into the battle we were all waiting for. Galadriel and the Númenóreans land in Middle-Earth, they quickly ride to the Southlands and help to win the battle from the orcs. Halbrand claims his kingship. Adar is held captive and the sword key that has been the focus for awhile is used in the end. It appears that Mount Doom has erupted - Mordor that we all know is now forming its barren wasteland.In the end we are still left wondering, Does Adar really believe he killed Sauron or is Adar really Sauron? We are a step closer to this truth. I still believe that Halbrand is Sauron - but well know soon enough.Overall, a fine episode that brought a lot of our main characters together and the story is coming together nicely.9/10.",Rainey-Dawn,9,0.2,No,Udûn,5,25
Will Udun save the day?,"Im very critically to The Rings of Power because I love Tolkien and the Jackson movies from it.The first 4 episodes really tested my patience.With episode 5 I discovered a movement.I think episode 6 could save the day because with the battle of the Numenoreans against the orcs and the evolution of Mordor the show runners hit the very interests of the viewers.Move on, Rings of Power!Youre on the right way to make Middle Earth fans happy!You told us who Adar is. Now explain us the Stranger, the Meteor Man. And show us the way to find out who is Sauron.- But please not the promised King of the Southern Lands Halbrand...-",grpe-48624,9,0.3333333333333333,Yes,Udûn,6,18
The pay off of this episode has been worth the wait,"With so much of this series waiting for something like this we can finally say the series has started. With every passing episode i was getting closer to not watching season 2. After this episode i cannot wait to see where this is going. This truly had everything that the trilogy of films had but with a much larger budget, with a lot of the series i cant wait to see if the final 2 episodes pay off.This is the type of story telling that should be shown in this series. The episode just had everything. From the darkness of the early battle without being over the top and seeing Legolas jumping on falling bricks but actually believable movements that mirror the original. The action was brutal, violent and well choreographed especially our 1 take shot of Arondir vs the Orc Captain. Obvious twist in that the humans were used as the first wave but what happened afterwards was great to see the stakes of whats happening really play out. Murdering hostages whilst interrogations were on going added another layer to the mythos of Tolkiens universe. Adar will be a very interesting character to follow after his escape.The Charge of the Numenor gave me real Pelennor Fields vibe on a smaller scale, the armor of the cavalry will inspire other kingdoms of middle earth in the third age. The helms are certainly the precursor to the Rohirrim just in place the nose guards have the horse lords sigil. Then Captain Elendils helm is the Guards of the Citadel where Elenil ultimately becomes king and sits upon the throne of men.Overall this is a story that is going to lead to some of the most amazing battles and characters before amazon finally hang up the Rings.",ha77y73ad97,9,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,1,3
Much more focused and even more spectacular!,"The sixth episode of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, titled Udûn, or Hell, merges several subplots from the series into an action-packed spectacle. So, for my part, I think this episode was the best episode of Rings of Power so far. Visually, the series takes a step forward when the first battle arrives, it starts to make things clearer in the story and also offers a much more focused story, the icing on the cake being the good handling of the characters and some dialogue.The episode features sixty minutes of action and raw emotion that will remind fans of the Lord of the Rings they know and love.And interestingly, its not just the narrative thats improved in episode six, but both the direction and cinematography are on another level, creating some of the most immersive and exciting sequences in the entire series so far. There are several scenes in this episode that can only be seen in an expensive blockbuster movie; And this proves that the series budget of 1 billion dollars has been well used in this episode.Undoubtedly, the sixth episode of Rings of Power is a non-stop battle that wants to excite the audience; And it succeeds in doing so. So, its almost funny that with such content and space to build excitement, the creators would set the tone of the previous episodes so slowly, when this episode is almost nothing but action and brings most of the main characters together.With this episode, Power Rings strengthens its position in the world of television. The episode contains spectacular drama and powerful action that explores the enemy in a way rarely seen in Tolkien adaptations. And this is the missing link of the series in the previous episodes. Episode VI, directed by Charlotte Brandström, features graphic gore, gruesome close-ups, thrilling action, and a massive twist that finally ties in perfectly with Tolkiens mythos.The episode Udûn has caused more good reviews and positive reactions than any other episode of this series; This is not surprising. Because this episode contains a fascinating hour of television. Its an exciting hour of adventure in Middle-earth. While the story uses clichés, it expands on them in thoughtful and provocative ways. So, if Rings of Power stays this way with its next two installments, it could be a decent work.",4liReza,9,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,1,3
This should be episode 3,"This is an excellent episode. It had more meaningful plot than the other episodes together. The pace was excellent. There were twists. There were character issues. There were conflicts. The most important aspect of this episode is that it was focused on serious conflict with the antagonist rather than nonsense conflicts between groups of protagonists as it was the case for most previous episodes. Moreover, as with each story, the protagonists are smart, but the villain is even smarter. I liked that. Some action sequences were impressive. And it all concluded with a decent cliffhanger. I regret so much that the episodes 2-5 were just spam.",lkacz1,9,0.5,No,Udûn,2,4
On par with Jacksons LotR,"I cant believe about 10% of users are rating this a 1 or 2, it would be a 9+ otherwise. Make it make sense.As my title claims, this episode was up there with the classic Jackson trilogy and I was quite surprised by that it had reached this level with two more episodes to go. The show makers have outdone themselves with this one.The visuals, the musical scores, the characters, the plot, eveything brilliant. There was non-stop action from the onset. The humans were smart, the orcs even smarter. There were a number of plot twists that would catch out even the most astute of viewer. Not eveything goes to plan and not every outcome is a victory, this is the reality and this is the sort of pragmatism I admired about this episode. The shoemakers really took the creative liberity to fleshout out some of the blanks that were missing from Jacksons trilogies and this was very much appreciated.",john_khan-74130,9,0.2916666666666667,No,Udûn,7,24
Better than you expect!,"Ive never much been a fan of Prime seriess, but knew I had to give this a try and Im glad I did.I havent read the LOTR books, so maybe that helped me overlook what others clearly dont/arent.Its beautiful to look at, the music is gorgeous and the characters are all believable....except maybe the young ones, but that can be forgiven.The first two episodes have been easy to follow and shows just enough lightheartedness along with its fair share of dark/horror.Dare I say Im enjoying the series more than the movies so far? This may be down to the characters mainly, as I was never a fan of Frodo and Sam.Maybe Ill update my review in time, but so far Im loving it.

"EPIC episode, to save the bad STORY.!!","I think this episode is one of the best ever in this series, because of the action, drama and excitement that accompanied the battles between the army of humans and the jinn against the orcs.I did not expect to hold any episode in this series more than 6 after the previous 5 episodes, this episode surprised me and I think it surprised everyone without exception.I hope for more action, drama and fighting. I hope to see a lot of excitement that covers the mistakes and disasters of the series story, the poor selection of actors and the insertion of agendas.My overall rating for the series will go up to 7/10 because of that episode and Ill give the episode same 9/10.",AtlanticPirateK,9,0.3125,No,Udûn,5,16
This episode makes the torture of 5 episodes worth bearing,"Finally this series has gained momentum and found its mojo.Action-packed; emotional scenes; close to the lore as possible. A focused episode that beautifully focused on the action at hand and its impact on each character, rather than meandering to different scenes that slow its pace. Meteor man and halflings also were absent. Thank Tolkein.Characters are also beginning to mark closer to their LOTR versions. Hallebrand gets lines that hint at who he truly is. Galadriel shows less scowel. And a spotlight is shone on Isildurs ambivalent and frail underpinnings to his later actions.Take a bow producers. This is what we waiting for. Pity this season is ending soon and rewatching the first 5 episodes provides no consolation till 2023.",kalpesh-3,9,0.2777777777777778,No,Udûn,5,18
Episode that made the season,"Im very glad that this episode ties everything neatly together in a grand spectacle that is the first one in season 1 that reminds us of the Peter Jackson movies. Even Galadriels much debated arc makes sense now. It seems fair to start with her because she is of course the topic of lots of discussion. Her story started in episode one with her brother Finrod telling her that sometimes we can only know which light to follow once we have seen the darkness. This now comes to full circle when confronted with Adar. Many didnt like the fact that she was just angry all the time but at least there was a good reason for this in the greater character arc. She is so mad she wants to kill Adar and not only that, she wants to make him watch while she kills every last ork in existence before that. Adar remarks that the dark lord might have found his successor. Galadriel now has seen the darkness, she now understand how one might become evil because she has felt the temptation herself.For me this fixes a lot of the problems I had with her character. The fact that at least it was all clearly a very deliberate choice in the greater narrative to make her behave like that. And this is fortunately true for other things as well. The tunnels the orks were digging all this time were not just a really dumb way to get around during sunshine, but were instrumental to the plan. The hilt Theo carried around indeed was more than just a evil weapon. The show perhaps shot itself in the foot a bit by so carefully setting up all these plotlines only to come together in the 6th episode. But im very glad it did. Even little things from earlier episodes became very significant like the Alfarin seeds planted by Adar, showing a reflection of his long lost Elven form. Other great references as well. Tolkien himself struggled with the fact that orks are irredeemable and just plain evil by nature. Adar addresses this issue in a thoughtful way and asks: arent orks just creatures as any other? I doubt he himslef thinks that but its a nice nod to the thoughts Tolkien himself had on the issue.All in all, the episode ties everything together very expertly and therefore a 10/10 because it really makes the show up to this point.",alexanderlunenborg,9,0.38461538461538464,Yes,Udûn,5,13
Interesting set up with amazing visuals,"A really enjoyable premiere. Characters are both interesting and new, but clearly harken to the familiar. Theres certain to be criticisms of a show that plays too-close to the fold of what has come before, but, is that always such a bad thing?The lore seems well-established, action scenes, though certainly not the focus of the episode were engaging. Locations seen were interesting and add depth to a Middle-Earth many have come to know from previous films. The plot also seems interesting on its own, even if one were not to know any connection to previous material. It will be interesting to see how this progresses.",jaredk-70888,9,0.3713355048859935,No,A Shadow of the Past,114,307
Good start,First episode was little slow in pacing in my opinion but otherwise great. The prologue was good. I wish amazon should have got the rights to the first age as well. That would have been great. But its still good.The visuals omg. They are stunning. 58 million per episode. It shows that on cgi. I was reminding myself that its not a movie but a show.It has potential to be a good show in my opinion. It will take me some time to learn all the names though. This felt like Middle Earth to me.Really liked Galadriel and Elrond. Two of my favs in this show so far. Also really liked the mystery towards the end.,fanficlover-62935,9,0.4444444444444444,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,9
Evil cannot create nothing new...and this is not in any form Evil. Im Hooked.,"The six Middle-Earth films by Peter Jackson are some of my all-time favorite movies, so when I heard that Amazon Studios were producing a TV show about Middle-Earth and Peter Jackson nor the rest of the creative team from the six-film saga werent working on this project, I was a little nervous.Then I heard that the show would not be directly connected into the movies, and I was a bit more nervous.Then came the trailer campaign, and my nervousness started to dissipate.I was a bit shocked at how much this production cost Amazon, and I was really worried, though.Also, with Amazons earlier foray (The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan) into the realms of dark fantasy was an absolute failure in my opinion, but thats just my opinion, so I was worried that this would turn out the same way.Wow, was I wrong. This pilot episode alone is great. Morfydd Clark does well as young Galadriel as does Robert Aramoyo as Elrond. The other characters, like the Harfoots, are very intriguing and should be interesting to learn about. The special effects and CGI are cinematic worthy. Bear McCrearys score is worthy of Howard Shore. The dialogue is great. The costume design is impressive. Im hooked. I love it.Im sticking with this show. Cant wait to watch the next episode!",zanghi_james,9,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,6,12
I loved it,"First of all, the visuals are absolutely incredible, as it should be with all this money involved. Many reviewers here seem to think this is the only positive part of the show so far.I strongly disagree. The story starts off slow but its a good introduction to (some of) the characters. The dialogue is pretty great although it might feel a little pretentious at times. Good acting across the board as well. Its not reasonable to expect what some people are expecting here, some of these reviews are truly baffling to me.Anyway, to each their own, but as a big Tolkien fan myself, i recommend it to anyone interested in the world of Middle-Earth.",bertmest,9,0.32142857142857145,No,A Shadow of the Past,9,28
Slow Burn World Building,"I loved the first episode. Though the pacing was slow, what Tolkien project isnt?You could feel the world building being done. I loved the introduction to characters and being back in Middle-Earth. The visuals were stunning and the storylines were all intriguing enough to keep me invested in the story going forward. The acting was impressive and added weight to a well made show. I love this show already. If you hate it, then dont watch it.I dont feel like I have to choose between this and House of the Dragon... they are just different. This feels like positive artistic high fantasy, while HotD feels like cynical realistic fantasy.Who knew Tolkien fans were as bad as Star Wars fans.... I truly dont understand why people need to share their hatred of something...",brookslangford,9,0.2857142857142857,No,A Shadow of the Past,8,28
Really enjoyed this episode,"Out of the two I watched, this one was my favorite so far. I enjoyed all of it. I was so immersed at the end that I did not wanted to end. I could watch the whole series in a single watch. It was that good and intriguing for me. Im not saying it was perfect, but none of the nowadays TV shows are, so looking for perfection will be waste of time. The journey were about to experience in the next 6 weeks will be very emotional and unpredictable. And Im all here for it. Again the visuals, the music, the dialogues and acting was great. Any objective person will find something to like in the series. I just dont get the over-reacted hate. I believe over time, this series will be better appreciated and received. People seems to not be ready to tone down the negativity and just enjoy any series for what they are.",jogobvg,9,0.4473684210526316,No,Adrift,17,38
Why so much hate?,"I was watching with open mind, maybe not as faithful adaptation but story based on work of Tolkien. And I think it was biggest mistake of Amazon, trying to promote this show as 100% word to word from a literary source.So as fantasy show it is really good show. I just hope I could tune down Galadriel, she is just unrealistically annoying right now.Dwarfs city it is just pure magic that bought my heart. Fairy tales, that pleasing as a part of a story, and visually fitting.Also Sea worm, as great as worms from Dune. That tells me that era of Television more and more pushing away audience from movie theaters.I really hope people would gave a fair try before just come and gave 1 out of hate.",holydrive,9,0.47058823529411764,No,Adrift,8,17
"So far, quite impressive","Unlike Jacksons LOTR, this story is not linear. There promises to be a lot of things going on.Realizing that I watched Episode One three times, and yes, I noticed something more each viewing.Im now in the 36th minute of Episode Two, on my first.What Im pointing out, and what I fully expected, is a lot of information, and a lot to absorb.I have found a series of essays, on different subjects for the Rings of Power. These gave me much insight of the show.For example, just from the First episode I rushed to think the the Stranger in the flame was Gandalf, arriving. Wrong.I do believe for those who will dedicate the time (such as those who are willing to watch the Twelve hours of the Trilogy) there will be much reward.Though, Im having a difficult time accepting Elves with short hair.",Rick3540,9,0.41379310344827586,No,Adrift,12,29
Magnificent!,"This series has met all my expectations. All this millionaire investment resulted in the largest TV production ever made. The photography of this series is beautiful, the soundtrack is magnificent and the mix of CGI with practical effects went really well here. Juan Antonio Bayona was a great choice to direct these first 2 episodes. He used a lot of those aerial images, which had already been established in this universe by Peter Jackson, but it looked really good here. The direction also left a movie atmosphere, especially in the first episode, the feeling is that I was watching a Blockbuster! In the second episode theres a sequel involving Galadriel that is breathtaking! Im really looking forward to the next episodes!",davianjos-26860,9,0.4,No,Adrift,10,25
Really beautiful start,"I was really excited for this. Ive watched it twice through now. I think the reviews that say its boring forget how long a slog LOTR is. And Silmarillion is not a single story but reads like, well a Bible, which is what it was based on. The whole point is that its about the journey. We get all the way through 6 lotr books for Frodo to SPOILER: fail. Because its not the point. The point is he tried. We skip over the journey in modern storytelling but this pacing is exactly on point for middle earth.Its fun to see the set ups for the different groups. You can see the seeds for all the things we know will happen from the stories we heard told in LOTR. Young Galadriel looks and sounds exactly as she should and clearly has the chops to anchor the series. Its fabulous to see the Frodo/Sam dynamic reborn and all of us girls who wanted to see ourselves in the fantastic four get to see ourselves in this duo now. Both actresses are engaging and dynamic. I think theyll be a lot of fun to watch.The people complaining about historic realism in a show about magic and dragons are just mad about everything and probably would complain about the original Jackson movies if social media had been what it is now.This episode ends with a bang, and sets us up well for the long journey ahead. Worth a watch.",boigonh,9,0.4,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,5
Great show!,This is a great show which really sucks you into this amazing fantasy world with interesting characters with stories revolving around the cultures in this world. Honestly one of my favorite shows of all time. Maybe a slow start but it picks up!It is such a shame that so many people are flat out review bombing this because of little issues that they have with it that do not by any means reflect the quality of the show; especially how the average viewer would feel about it. It is so sad that the loudest voices are the negative ones.The visuals are incredible (aside from some obvious character CGI replacements that are only really on this episode). The acting was great and the cast is incredible. I would definitely recommend this show!,greatdesigns-31829,9,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,2
"So far, so good","This episode was captivating and tightly written. The writers had a huge task of introducing the peoples of Middle Earth and the story that they want to tell. They do a good job of switching people storylines and giving us points of data withouty revealing too much or spilling over too much into exposition. There is a clear arc to the episode, the end recalls both visually and in the dialogue the beginning. There were a few moments that pulled me out of the story, like when Galadriel punches through a wall of ice: Galadriel smash! Not only was it silly, but no one taught Morfydd how to throw a punch, so it looks extra hokey. But so much more pulled me in: the attention to plants, for example: the portrayal of the Birch-like Mallorn trees in Lindon or knowing that hobbits love blackberries and presuming they got that from their ancestors. I think they did a great job in episode 1. Im looking forward to episode two!",yomamazas,9,0.625,No,A Shadow of the Past,5,8
Another great episode,"After a first episode in which the conflict to come was unclear, this second episode follows along four main threads, with various challenges to face.Galadriel is... Swimming. For a while. Must have been quite interesting to shoot. She meets a group of people that do not last long, and a big fish quite hungry. I am very curious about the man she meets. Another lost king, like Aragorn? Is his kingdom where Sauron waits? Will we go there? Ill need a map to get who is going where honestly ahaha. From previous trailers I have some good ideas on who they are about to meet, and I am excited about that.Nori and Poppy have my favorite arc this episode. The man they have found is soooo mysterious. With little lore knowledge, I have only vague hypothesis on who he could be, but he got magic and is dangerous, so theres that. The scene with the fire and the results of the meteor was soooo pretty. Also Nori and Poppy have the best relationship developed so far in the show. They are hilarious!Elrond needs to help that other elf (... I am very suspicious about what he will do with his new forge), so went to see his friend Durin. Khazad Dum was absolutely splendid. And the music when Elrond got there? The percussion? Amazing. Durins wife (Disa?) was great, Im guessing well see her do some singing and this will be magestic. What was that light at the end? One of the two lights? Something else?Alrondir and Bronwyn are interesting so far. What was in those tunnels? Why are they being made? And can Theo stop playing with Saurons sword???Overall a great episode, kept me entertained and invested, with many questions to see answered.

A really amazing second episode.,"While I did enjoy the first episode, I did find some moments to be rather slow. But this episode was very entertaining. So many interesting characters with interesting story lines. I like the hole mystery theme of this episode, with some characters trying to figure out what the heck is going on around them. There were some really funny moments that made me laugh. And moments that made me gasp, which I was not expecting.I think the acting was a lot better in this episode and I really connected with some of the new characters, especially the dwalfs.

Shes been nasty to him from start.Im also so intrigued with meteor man. Good or evil? Did he kill the fireflies??The Harfoots keep growing on me. Nori is such a great person!And then Khazad-dûm. Ooooooooooooo my jaw dropped. Brilliant. Stunning. Gorgeous. The dwarves were no longer silly comic relief. They were real, with big feelings, a great culture. Not to toy with.

Dwarven Kingdom feels real,"Im impressed how the dwarven Kingdom in the mountain truly had the feeling of being real, an ecosystem, deep caverns, well done.The relationship between the elf and dwarven friends is unique, showing how dwarves truly can be short tempered, and elves aloof of the differences of other races. Im trying not to use too many spoilers here also.The music in this episode set the tone at times.The boy really seems to be playing with fire in this episode, and you would think hed be more aware of it.... One of those scenes where you want to say to the character what are you doing!?
The audience can tell it was obviously going to be a bad idea... But a character is thinking about it anyway.... And I generally find the younger actors are not all that convincing unfortunately.",BigBlueBoat,9,0.5,No,Adrift,1,2
Inject that right into my veins.,"That was amazing, I would give it a solid ten if not for the very odd line that made me cringe a little!Since episode 4 the quality has risen and this by far is the best episode, its extraordinary for a tv show that was mind blowing. The action is phenomenal and weighty, every hit you can feel. It was filled with so much tension, and when you think its eased it up the tension comes again, then you think youre safe, everything is ok and boom hit you with an even bigger thing. At 70 minutes long it flies by and leaves you with wanting more.The cinematography is an absolute dream, has been throughout the series.

"Aesthetically and musically pleasing, with a good intro to many characters","With that budget, it does not come as a surprise that this first episode is visually gorgeous. Tolkiens epic fantasy is back, and it is colorful and stunning and I am excited to get many more episodes of this. Musically, I am already blown away by several of the musical themes, and I honestly cant wait to dive deep into the soundtrack (but I may wait until the first season is over to do so).Story wise, this first episode does a great job seeing up its world and characters. I came in only knowing Galadriel and Elrond, as I havent read most of Tolkiens work, but have grown attached to many of the characters we just discovered. Nori the harfoot is cute in her curiosity, and the ending of the first episode got me concerned about her fate. Theo, Bronwyns son, has found something that he probably should not have touched. I am deeply invested into Galadriels fight. I know many more characters have still to be introduced, and I am excited to get to see them.It may sounds cheesy on paper, but I appreciate what was done with the map of the Middle Earth. Since we are jumping between places, its nice to visualize where everything is.This episode ends with signs that a darkness just woke up again in this world. Lets now see how our characters deal with it.",rationalnerd,9,0.2542372881355932,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,45,177
A beautiful albeit a little slow start to a series with great potential,"With controversy all across the internet about this show it was relieving to finally watch it and make my own opinion. As a massive fan of the movies ever since I was a child I had big expectations. The rings of power from a technical standpoint is pretty flawless. The CGI,practical effects,costumes and set designs were beautiful. The music while not as good as Howard Shores music is still effective and creates that different world kind of atmosphere. This episode was very exposity heavy and while much needed especially for the scale they are trying to achieve it did bog the episode down. The dialogue is great so farwhich something I was worried about. The story looks to be promising but as said this episode is just to start building. Overall a promising start and I cant wait to see more.",calebjones-14268,9,0.3,No,A Shadow of the Past,57,190
An atmospheric introduction to a world beyond the movies,"This episode makes some nods to the movie trilogys style and atmosphere, without ever directly copying it. Unlike the movies, we get to see a more vibrant, more dynamic side of tolkien, with a truly living world.Music throughout this episode bears some vague similarities to the soundtrack of the movies at times, particularly, when Sauron is brought up. However, otherwise it is fully independent.I have to praise the different points of view for all of the races of Middle Earth, as they truly gave each of them somewhat of a distinct vibe, which is rarely achieved in other shows that feature multiple regions.",mgrmareklach,9,0.5714285714285714,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,7
Surprisingly good!,"I was very skeptical about the series. I criticized the liberties taken and hoped they stick to the material as much as possible. Im quite rigid when it comes to literary works, and prefer the movies that stick to the original work. I didnt even want to watch this series. However, after accidentally renewing my Amazon subscription, I gave it a try.The actors are simply wonderful. I feel that well see some good chemistry developing throughout the season. The stories are well connected and even the stories created just for the series look very close to what Tolkien would have made. There is much respect to his work, all while adapting the material to what they felt it was necessary, which I greatly appreciate. The music is really beautiful and well-fitting and the effects are very well made.I was pleasantly surprised and I cant wait for the next episodes :-)",DianaFiD,9,0.5714285714285714,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,7
Dwarfs greatness,"I love how they captured the spirit and the mentality of the dwarf king and the dwarfs in general. How they first showed him as not being welcome at all, but slowly revealing him being hurt by not seeing his good friend for a long time, is just brilliantly written and heartwarming at the same time. Also how the elb is beeing clever, polite and charming is really fun to watch. It shows must character depth in both characters in very few scenes, what is my highlight in both episodes so far. Furthermore is to mention, how stunning these visual effects are. Looks fantastic and is better than most youll see in every other production.",timlueber,9,0.391304347826087,Yes,Adrift,9,23

HOLY SPIT!!!,"Wow... If this story follows some semblance of logic then it just killed off almost all of its main characters in one fell swoop. Just like that, theyre all dead... Thats $&amp;@$ing crazy. Especially Galadriel. She absolutely has to be dead. Unless Elves can survive a raging inferno or have some sort of magic they didnt mysteriously use until now, shes totally $&amp;@$ed. So is everyone else in that village. They have to all be dead! How is anyone going to survive something like that?! Theres no way!On the other hand, it would be totally nuts to kill off most of your characters like that. Where would you go from there? You only have the Hobbits left. But, you know there going to find some crazy $&amp;@$ing way to keep them alive. Saved by some, just in the nick of time, miracle. All of the important characters will somehow live.Man, can you imagine the balls it would take to commit to something like that as a writer. Killing off all those story characters like that? Youd have to start fresh with a bunch of new characters and/or go back to the ones that remain elsewhere in the world. But theyre not going to do that and thats kind of disappointing because Id be very interested to see what happens after that. I mean, I guess Im interested either way.So in short: If they kill off all of them - Thats shocking and Id be very interested to see where it goes from there. If they kill off some of them - Thats still shocking and interesting especially if its an important character. If no one dies then that will be disappointing. In that case, Id feel like I was tricked. The old bait and switch. Because if they are trying to create a fantasy world that feels real i.e. It obeys some semblance of our physical laws even though it is fantastical in nature, it still follows rules, then there must be consequences for what just happened. Important people must die!But theyre not going to do that. Everyone is going to miraculously live and Im just talking in circles.",ghost0ne,9,0.3541666666666667,Yes,Udûn,17,48
The Aftermath,"In the aftermath of the volcano erupting the survivors are looking for the missing and dead. Some are trapped while others lay in eternal rest. The Harfoots make it to their next destination with some devastating surprises. The cult in white are still on the trail of The Stranger. Durin IV and Elrond are out to convince Durin III that the elves need the mithral desperately.Good episode overall. I dont have many complaints with what has happened nor what was said. I only have one gripe: Why did Galadriel made us think that Celeborn was dead? I can only assume shell be surprised later in the series that hes alive.Anyway, I am pleased with the episode in spite of my one complaint.9/10.",Rainey-Dawn,9,0.20634920634920634,Yes,The Eye,13,63
The calm after the storm,"I like the more calmer episode 7 after the action filled episode 6. It was very emotional, especially the Elrond-Durin scenes and the Galadriel-Theo scenes.I was a bit disappointed that nobody important died in the volcano, because the grief would have felt more real. But over all the loss of their home and their world as they knew it hit hard.The mithril-heals-sickness plot is a bit weird, I had thought it a lie planted by Sauron, but the healed leaf proves me wrong. Unless the sickness is specifically created by Sauron to be healed that way? I mean, as a way to trick the elves to forge mithril Rings. I still have hope!It was great to have Celeborn name dropped at last! I wonder where he is. (He cant be dead because we know hes alive in the Lord of the Rings) Maybe Halbrand and Galadriel will pass through whats going to be Lothlórien and find him there with Amdír and the others? But then why havent he looked for Galadriel in all these years? Very intriguing.Lastly, the Harfoots. Is the Stranger going to meet Oropher and Thranduil? They talked about Greenwood the Great. Unless Nori and Poppy catch up with him first. Looking forward to see it all tie together, but I expect new characters like Thranduil wont appear until season 2.All in all a great episode, full of build up to the finale. I hope for many answers, and am a bit worried too lol. Please dont mess this up, writers!",jemimahammarlund,9,0.23076923076923078,Yes,The Eye,12,52
Immersive Unveilings - E03 Review,"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power had, in just two debut episodes, proven it could survive under the beloved banner of Peter Jacksons original trilogy, of which I am one of millions of diehard fans.The series - whose first two episodes I previously reviewed in detail - has also proven that it can take calculated and well-read detours from J. R. R. Tolkiens original books that inspired it. Such manipulations may not have sat well with some fans, but I for one believe that scripting such an ambitious story in the 2k era demands some change for two core reasons:a. The intricate and irreplaceable prose of Tolkiens work cannot in all fairness be fully adapted to the screen. In this regard, the imaginations of fans are superior even to Amazon Studios resources.B. Curtailing such a lengthy and almost divinely detailed story required clever detours, which I believe is what the writers, directors, and producers of this show did. And they managed to do it better than expected.That said, we delve right into the character of Adar, who does not feature in Tolkiens original stories but which the team saw fit to make the cynosure of episode 3 Rings of Power. This was yet another interesting deviation from canon, as mentioned earlier.To understand the significance of Adars entry into the plot - though only near episodes end, and that too barely - we need to consider the story of the Orcs after they dispersed en masse following the defeat of Morgoth. A new power was indeed rising, namely Sauron, and it prompted the disbanded orcs to unite under the sorcerous shadow of their former Lords pupil and successor.The orcs were considered fallen Elves in Tolkiens book The Silmarillion in which numerous plot-revisions were yet incomplete. Tolkiens son Christopher did his best to fill in the blanks and gave fans a version of the tale that came as close as it possibly could to what Tolkien may have envisioned, in this case for the orcs.The word/name Adar means father, which now points to a clever possibility as to how the orcs came to be, not to mention their racial hierarchy. In my opinion, Adar has little to do with Sauron except that he may play an integral role in gathering the orcs to his cause. Adar may well be Saurons number-one intermediary.The Rings of Power thus started to peel off another important layer that revealed the shows trajectory. Galadriel previously learned of the orcs presence in the Southlands, an area which would much later become the dreaded Mordor, i.e., Saurons HQ. Adar may also lead Saurons forces in his expansionist campaign to take over the Southlands and remake it into Mordor. Galadriels discovery in the far North about dark and sorcerous experimentations on orcs also tied in well with Adars entry.Now, there is the off-chance that Adar is indeed Sauron. I say this because the Dark Lord has been known to shape-shift in Tolkiens stories, and do so rather convincingly. It was how Sauron even took on the guise of the fair Elf Annatar in whose skin he was able to glean the precise techniques he needed from Celebrimbor when the master-smith created the original rings of power. Sauron later made his One Ring in secret and made sure that it had the power to control and corrupt all the other rings given to the Elves, Humans, and Dwarves.Only time will tell more, but I personally feel that the Rings of Power showrunners may have decided to let Adar be the red herring fans will assume was Sauron. Until future episodes reveal the Dark Lords full diabolical plans, of course. I also feel Adar is his own character, because to make him Sauron in disguise would be to once again meddle with Tolkiens lore, especially what he wrote about this iconic villain. Such a task may prove too risky in the long run for screenplay writers, even those as talented as the ones who scripted Rings of Power for Amazon Prime Video.Director Wayne Che Yip did excellent work on episode 3. Writers Jason Cahill and Justin Doble typed up a great screenplay. S01E03 Rings of Power: Adar also boasted excellent production design, great music by Bear McCreary, and notable VFX - what they did with Númenor was *chefs kiss*. Editing and sound effects were quite good. Hair-makeup and costume were exemplary - the looks they created for the orcs were credible and brilliant, to say nothing of their attention to sundry Númenorean nuances.I covered more crew and cast-related details in my dual-episode review, so I shall stick to the bare minimum in this one.Galadriel, played by Morfydd Clark, continued to impress. Halbrand (non-canonical character), played by Charlie Vickers, was notable. Queen Regent Míriel, played by Cynthia Addai-Robinson, was outstanding. Arondir (non-canonical character), played by Ismael Cruz Cordova, was superb. Watchwarden Revion (non-canonical character), played by Simon Merrells, was good. Captain Elendil, played by Lloyd Owen, was great. Pharazôn (who will later canonically become the last king of Númenor), played by Trystan Gravelle, was memorable. Isildur, played by Maxim Baldry, was great. Eärien (non-canonical character), played by Ema Horvath, was interesting. Nory Brandyfoot, played by Markella Kavenagh, was good. Marigold Brandyfoot, played by Sara Zwangobani, was notable. Largo Brandyfoot, played by Dylan Smith, was quite good. Poppy Proudfellow, played by Megan Richards, was great. Sadoc Burrows (non-canonical character), played by Lenny Henry, was memorable.The so-far-secret presence and work of the orcs - including kidnapping, enslavement, and forced labour - were revealed in this episode. Mysteries gradually came to light and added to the rich lore, both traditional and modified, that has come to define Rings of Power in recent days.The great port-city and island-kingdom of Númenor (aka Elenna-nórë or Westernesse) was at last revealed in glorious detail. It was absolutely stunning! Much of the architecture was so evocative of Gondors Gates of Argonath (or Pillars of Kings) and of course Minas Tirith (or the Tower of Guard). They also had a large beacon tower that reminded me of the warning beacons of Gondor, and a tree that called to mind the great White Tree of Gondor (the one in E03 hailed from the same legendary species). The Númenorean ships were also designed to perfection. I was riddled with goosebumps watching Númenors reveal sequence unfold.The coming of Elendil was also superb. He will later (in Tolkien canon) become one of the greatest warriors of the Dúnedain, not to forget the first King of both exiled realms Arnor and Gondor. He will also later die alongside Gil-galad (the Elven King) during the Siege of Barad-dûr (War of the Last Alliance, late Second Age) perpetrated by Sauron.Remember that guy at the fiery pit in Mount Doom, Mordor? The one who inspired all those memes? The one who refused to listen to Elrond - in Jacksons original trilogy - when he was asked to cast the One Ring into the fire? That man is Isildur, and we see his younger version making a memorable entry in this episode. Along with his brother Anárion, Isildur will (in Tolkien canon) later go on to rule Gondor in the south. He will also become the one to cut off the finger that held Saurons One Ring - this will happen much later in War of the Last Alliance after he picks up his fathers sword. Many ages later, his heir Aragorn will come to reclaim his rightful place, as witnessed in Jacksons original trilogy. Isildurs character-entry thus added something momentous to Rings of Power.The (low-key) Harfoot harvest festival was showcased this episode. While it brought distinct Bilbo Baggins on his eleventy-first birthday vibes, it more importantly held deeply emotional elements worth watching. One could tell from where the Hobbits later derived some of their traditions.Every design of the orcs, including performances and voiceovers, made me feel nostalgia for Peter Jacksons original trilogy. The orcs in Rings of Power were familiar yet fresh, in a manner of speaking, which only added to the thrills contained in episode 3, and promised plenty of action and intrigue in future episodes to come.",BijeshNagesh,9,0.4474885844748858,No,Adar,98,219
Better .. WAY better,"This episode was so good, way better than the first twoNice visuals, nice fight scenes (even though I liked Halbrand fight more, I like human fights more than 4 meters in the air jump)Anyway,Nori nothing against the actress. Shes fine, but I wish they could choose a younger actress.Halbrand is the cell and the conversation with Galadriel. Well done from Halbrand (actor) but sorry for the actress, she was a bit off (if I could rate them based on that scene, the actor will get a 9/10 and Im being nice giving her a 4/10, sorry)I like how the episode ended too, well played but I wish they didnt show his face and kept for the next episode .Still dont get all this hate, its LOTR story and you judge 1 or 2 episodes ? Smhanyway, ADAR ADAR ADAR.",thewhiteknight-82835,9,1.0,Yes,Adar,2,2
Getting better,"A lot of people judged this series just for its two first episodes which were not bad actually for begining and i think it was not right to judge it quickly.Because this is the most expensive series of all time and we should wait to see whats coming and i think it is going to be really interesting .Its getting interested at least for me and i think most of you are in my side and the are chosen really good.And also Im not the one who should rate series and films, and these are just my opinions.But, i just have one question:
can you tell me why we didnt see anything about humans who traveled to the Elves lands?",ahmadisina-89733,9,0.4098360655737705,No,Adar,50,122

I feel the ending was be the best ending on the TV
Im so exciting now because this episode 3 the end was beautiful
And the dialogues was amazing i love it so much and so dramatically and the acting was very beautiful.",riyadmustafa-53239,9,0.373134328358209,Yes,Adar,50,134
Lets look at it fairly,"So far, the series has shown that it is going to get better and surprise us every episode.The third part is very nicely made compared to the first two parts and it goes further with the arrival of the characters we know and were not in the trilogies and we only heard their names or were well mentioned in Tolkiens world.The series becomes more interesting.What has surprised me so far is its amazing visual effects, the cities that we only visualized in our minds, now we see that they have been built even more beautiful than our imagination, such as Nomenor and Khazd II, which we only see as ruins. We had seen it
Be patient and look ahead.",omiddanaii,9,0.41379310344827586,No,Adar,12,29
From just good to really great,"Oke, so first of all I have seen a lot of reviews coming in before I really thought. Oke, now its time to put some time in and give my thoughts. Because to be honest. Some low ratings are a bit unfair in my opinion.The first 2 episodes where really about telling the story and getting to know some characters. To be honest, I did found myself trying to convince myself to why they choose some actors for characters like Elrond and the elf king Gil-galad. They just didnt seem to fit the part when I first saw them on the screen. That being said, Elrond did grew on me in the second episode. So I hope the elf king will do the same. Galadriel btw feels amazing, she, as expected, with Arondir, a Silvan Elf soldier carry the first 2 episodes for me.Both there storylines feel like they should end up together at some point. Both Galadriel and Arondir have that sense that there is more at work then meets the eye.Lets not forget the Dwarfs and Khazad-dûm. What a beautiful city they have build in the mountains. And how cool was it to see the suspicious mind of the king. And we all know why when we see that last scene with DurinBoth episode 1 and 2 are good and like I said give the audience an good introduction about where and when everything takes place.Coming into episode 3 it really shifts to from just good, to really great. Even more introductions to some really cool and known characters. And lets not forget, not only characters, but also places. What an island really amazing. The history about that place is also very intriguing. So many lines are open now and it gives the mind enough space to start thinking about all the cool storys yet to come.In the first 2 episodes we didnt really see much of Orcs. And when we did see something slightly Orc-ish. It didnt really felt like the orcs I knew from the movies (and I know I should not compare everything with the movies, but it should give that LOTRs vibe which we know from the Peter Jackson films).But then, this also changed when coming into episode 3. The way Arondir was dragged through the holes and put down with his fellow elf soldiers. And then seeing some shots of Orcs and how they react and interact with each other. Yes, just yes, its becoming to really take form now. This is also why i feel the show is really letting people slowly fall in love with it.Its what we expected, it should feel like something new, more to Tolkien then to Peter Jackson (Who did a beautiful job in the films). And i think thats what some other reviewers forget. The magic of the films is the magic of the films, this can not be replaced, ever.But yes, now we can have some new magic, and like I said, this is magic. From just good to really great magic. Hoping (and i just know) the magic will continue in the upcoming episodes.",dhcdeblock,9,0.4166666666666667,Yes,Adar,10,24
Its way better compared to the past medicore episodes,"In this episodes things are really different compared to the past ones, this one has good acting, good writing, and good scenery.Elrond and Durin are the shining stars of the show with their part being the best, the elve and the dwarf are the best characters in the show their relation is really beautiful, both actors have done a great job playing their characters.Galadriel and her part of the episode was really good as well with the character finally saying a couple of things that actually make sense.The Hobbit part was really good as well gave us a couple of things here and there that was entertaining and interesting .In general this episode is the best one yet
The show was a disappointment till the last episode where the ending was fine and this episode is really good, its not perfect and the 9 I gave it is probably a little bit too much, but, if the show keeps the Same level of good writing and acting in the upcoming episodes I can say it will be saved and may actually be worth your time.",omalola-14223,9,0.2,No,The Eye,10,50
"A great show, probably much better for those who know nothing about the books","I have been really enjoying this show, and have been scratching my head as to why others seem to be so disappointed in it.I think it is suffering from two main problems for audiences.1) Those who have great depth of knowledge of the world created by Tolkien are spotting all the divergences from Tolkien (I love The Hobbit and LoTR but havent read the Appendices since I was about ten years old, so for me this is not an issue).2) The show is trying to straddle the dividing line between The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books. The Hobbit was a much more gentle childrens book. LoTR was a weighty tome full of depth and history and language of incredible complexity and real darkness.On the one hand this show is trying to delve into the darker aspects of Sauron and his minions, and how he plays on the weaknesses of men and other races, whilst on the other hand it is trying to cram exposition in that a five year old could follow.This reminds me, in a strange way, of the British sci-fi series Torchwood, the first two seasons of which could not seem to decide if it wanted to be edgy and dark and sexy, or still in the more silly and child-friendly world of Doctor Who.For me each episode of this series has got better, and in particular, this ep directed by Wayne Yip, who has some excellent prior TV eps of a variety of different shows under his belt, pushes further into more interesting territory.Is it perfect? No. Will it become perfect? Possibly once those behind it make a firm decision about what it wants to be. However, given Wayne Yip took over as Showrunner for the second series onwards, I really think that will happen and in a very good way.For me though, I am 100% up for sticking with it to find out.",medwards-85263,9,1.0,No,Adar,1,1
Finally.,"I loved the first episode but apart from looking beautiful at times I found 2 &amp; 3 a little boring with scenes feeling unnecessarily drawn out, this episode however everything starts falling into place from the off. Once again were treated to some of the most stunning looking tv but with an added bonus of great story telling, great directing and a fantastic score which makes one scene in particular (youll know it if youve watched) not just exhilarating but a piece of art.Im really hoping the rest of the series sticks with this level of writing, this wasnt just the best episode of the season by far but one of the great single episodes of a fantasy show.",paul-gibbons22,9,0.4864864864864865,No,The Great Wave,18,37
Seeds of future,Best episode of the series by far.Harfoot nonsense not present in this episode.Beautifully shot and acted.Series now getting into the actual story and it is will get more interesting now.Hopefully people will ignore the negativity towards the series and embrace it as we need this story to complete.This episode gave me hope that creators are serious and they have thought through the storyline.Galadriel is very good and the scenes with Durin and Elrond is very good.The accent of Lady Durin us very off and I think they can dial it down a little.Hopefully they will make Harfoot story connected or remove it from the series.,smotesha,9,0.5333333333333333,No,The Great Wave,8,15
The development of the show and its characters is great and getting better with each episode.,"I have enjoyed the Tolkien universe as far as books and films are concerned and LOTR to this day is still my favourite storyline of all-time.I have been following the release of this show from the beginning when they bought the rights to Tolkiens books.Did the first two episodes fulfill its high expectations? No. I had to stop making comparisons and so I started watching episode 3 with a clean slate and I really enjoyed it. Episode 4 even more. The story is coming together and I simply love how they take the time to develop the relations between certain characters, take Durin and Elrond for instance. Great duo. The Hobbit folks? Also very entertaining.Give it a go and keep an open mind, do not compare it or crucify it because it does not line up with the books. They are being creative with it, did they have to do that? No. I prefer some storylines to be as they used to be but they have every right to make their adaptations.Nonetheless I am glad we have some kind of Tolkien story back in our lives.Regards.",PhilippeSchaaf,9,0.6666666666666666,No,The Great Wave,2,3
One of the best episodes yet!,"I loved this episode. So many intriguing storylines weaved together. You can feel the momentum of the show moving towards an intersection of many key characters.It is so fun to not know who Sauron is yet. He is a shape shifter and a deceiver, and there are many possible contenders.Very interesting take on the power of Mithral and the reason the elves are wanting it. In Tolkiens mythology, Galadriels ring of power is partially constructed of mithral - maybe the show runners are going to expand this idea to all the rings of power. This Idea makes me wonder if Sauron in disguise is already influencing the elves in some way.I cant wait for next weeks episode!",julie-926,9,0.2574626865671642,Yes,Partings,69,268
So far the best episode,"First of all, after watching the first 4 episodes I have to say that I didnt find the series particularly bad, but not good either, it was simply all right. Among other things, this was so because although I am watching a Lord of the Rings series. I was not really in Middle-earth. Unfortunately, the series lacks the music that made me feel at home when I watched Lord of the Rings...Nevertheless, after I have watched every episode, I must say this one doesnt really has anything that bothers me. I find the Dialogue as well as the character interactions in general to be the best so far. Especially Elronds dialogue in this Episode. For the first time I find myself intrigued into the story, and Im looking forward to seeing the next episode.Still I am giving it a 9/10 because I believe as I said the series lacks the music that defines Lord of the Rings. Maybe also because of something else, but as of now I cant think of anything else.This was my first review, so I hope you can somehow understand my thoughts.",schmiedeckelukas,9,0.31746031746031744,Yes,Partings,40,126
This Wandering Day - what a beautiful way to start the episode,"I have been loving Rings of Power since the first episode. I appreciate how much time is being spent on developing the characters --- not just the main characters but the supporting ones as well. My favorite characters so far are Nori, Arondir, Durin, The Stranger, Bronwyn, and Elrond.Poppys song This Wandering Day was really lovely and fits right in with other classic songs like Misty Mountains. In fact, this whole soundtrack is excellent. I have been a fan of Bear McCreary ever since his work on Battlestar Galactica and Black Sails and am so very impressed with what he has done with this soundtrack. I have been trying to not listen to the soundtrack beyond the point were at in the season to avoid potential spoilers but I know after the season is out I will definitely be revisiting the soundtrack.",dreamlife613,9,0.41935483870967744,No,Partings,13,31
This Wandering Day got to me.,"That song! Such a fine nod to Tolkien, it had me in tears.The mysteries continue. (For the record, I think Halbrand is just himself, and perhaps the ancestor of Theoden. I think the stranger is Gandalf, and I find the mysteries and guessing and picking out clues interesting.I like the way they are developing Isildur as a whiny, entitled brat with no sense of community and an overwhelming and undeserved sense of himself. When what happens at the Gladden Fields happens (the idiot!), this is precisely the younger version who would grow up to make such a terrible mistake.I think the Halbrand decision-making was given short shrift, my one complaint. Lovely visuals again.And OMG, that song.",grnhair2001,9,0.3289902280130293,Yes,Partings,101,307
Epic battle!,"All the storylines coming together was just epic. It was intense, with lots of nice sceming etc, and many twists...Im so curious where it will all lead. Is Halbrand really who he says he is? What happends next?Some fan theories proved to be right this episode, particularly the identity of Adar. I thought he was Maeglin from the 1st Age, which would have been cool imo, but this works too.And Galadriel had to battle her inner demons... I like that shes morally grey!Only downside: Arondir and Bronwyn have NO chemistry. At all. I dont root for them and just hope they both meet someone else lol.",jemimahammarlund,9,0.38095238095238093,No,Udûn,8,21
"Getting better, yet a bit too heavy on the Harfoots","This show gives me mixed feelings, the CGI and vistas are breathtaking as in the lighting and overall acting. The music is very LotR like, what weight on the show is the Harfoot element, thought its cute at times , are not really a thing in this Era in the history of MIddle Earth, they are/wer insignificat and the series highlights their presence and story line too much in my opinion. Actualy I dont know why they are in the show at all, beside perhaps, the hint at the early ancestors of the Hobbits. If I were one of the producers I would tone the Harfoot element in the next season significantly down and focus on the big events that span something like 3 millennia in the original legends and HUman Elves and Dwarves are the protagonist and Orgs Goblins and ofcourse Saurons other minions the antagonist. Storyline enough there I would say. In any case I am still enjoying the show inmensely, primarily based on the visual audio candy and the developing (minus the Harfoots) storyline.",meelkliko,9,0.273972602739726,No,Adar,20,73
Season One: Amazons Big Bet Pays Off By Replicating The Feel Of Tolkiens Universe,"After spending more to create Rings of Power than any other series in company history, Amazon Prime released the series--to absolutely terrible reviews. It got to the point where even as a huge Lord of the Rings books &amp; movie, I was wary of diving into this. Im so glad I did, however, as I found it to be a marvelous venture back into the LOTR universe.For a very basic overview, Rings of Power is set thousands of years before Frodo (or even Bilbo) go off adventuring. It focuses primarily on these storylines...-The elf Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) trying to hunt down the mysterious Sauron, who she believes has assumed the power vacuum created by the evil Morgoth. Along the way, Galadriel befriends fellow traveller--and potential human king--Halbrand (Charlie Vickers) as they fight together to preserve the legacy of Numenor. Also involved in this plot line? A young Isildur (Maxim Baldry), who hears the call of something he cannot explain.-Another elf, Elrond (Robert Aramayo), and his unique friendship with dwarf Durin IV (Owain Arthur) as they discover a special substance deep underground that may hold the key to the survival of both races.-As the Harfoots (a type of being similar to a Hobbit but not quite the same) embark on their annual pilgrimage harvest, a mysterious Stranger (Daniel Weyman) crashes to (Middle) Earth in their midst. This event appeals to the burgeoning curiosity of young Nori Brandyfoot (Markella Kavenagh) and friend Poppy (Megan Richards), and they both help the new arrival discover just who/what he may be.-Though a bit shorter in length, a fascinating arc involving Orcs--led by enigmatic Adar (Joseph Mawle)--perhaps turns conventional thought on that complicated species on its head.For me, Rings of Power did a fantastic job of capturing the essence/feel of the books/films and re-introducing me into Tolkiens expansive universe. Does it go beat-for-beat of The Silmarillion or Tolkiens lengthy indexes? No--hence the many negative reviews from what I presume are more hard-core Tolkien scholars than I. But in terms of giving me that feeling I had reading the books as a child or viewing the films as an adolescent, this first season of Rings of Power provided that in spades.In a sense, this season could almost be considered a sort of prologue, what with the titular piece of jewelry not as prominent as one might expect. But this bothered me not a bit, as the acting, set pieces, music, and Tolkien lore were all so on-point--the perfect blend of new material and callbacks to more established LOTR material.So, if you consider yourself a fan of Tolkiens Lord of the Rings via the books and/or films but arent necessarily a scholar of his deeper stuff, Rings of Power is most definitely the show for you! Though perhaps taking a few episodes to re-create that atmosphere, by the end you will likely feel the same as the first time you flipped the final page of the book trilogy or the last time you exited the theater from Peter Jacksons epics.",zkonedog,9,0.10526315789473684,No,Alloyed,2,19
Best Episode Thus Far,"I would argue that this is the best episode of the series so far. I believe we have scratched a name off the list as to who Sauron is not - but that is still not written in stone; new episodes could reveal otherwise.The pace is fast as some of Númenor prepare to set sail with Galadriel to Middle-Earth. Halbrand almost tell us of who he really is - yet does not. Our mysterious Stranger (Meteor Man) speaks a few more words to Nori and is shown that he still has trouble controlling his magic. High King Gil-galad has revealed a secret to Lord Elrond concerning the fate of the Elves - and news concerns the Dwarves. Theo reveals something to Arondir and later to Bronwyn - together they make a terrible discovery.This episode had me changing my mind on who Halbrand, Adar, The Stranger, The Cult Leader in White and Sauron are. Right now its still anyones guess - even if we can scratch off one of them as Sauron - or so its stands at the end of this episode. None of them has been revealed yet so they all remain mysterious.9/10.",Rainey-Dawn,9,0.2631578947368421,No,Partings,10,38
Redemption,"Episode 8 redeems episodes 1 through 5 and elevates the series. Peter Jacksons movies never addressed Saurons charming ability to ensnare others to his ways, yet alone his belief that his motives were noble. When I read the introduction to the Silmarillion, Tolkien spoke at length of this self-deception and of the fall, always the fall, of good into evil.I thought the scenes between Galadriel and Sauron were brilliantly written and acted. I now believe next season will be wonderful. How fun was it to see how and why the rings were forged? Delightful. The rest of the episode pleased me too. I think we have the emergence of Gandalf. Ive either adjusted or accepted the Harfoots and Im looking forward to Noris adventures. When the stranger said a journey is for one but an adventure was more than one, I loved that. The dialogue was fantastic. I think they have hit their stride and I look forward to next year.",ociopia,9,0.17391304347826086,Yes,Alloyed,4,23

But I still do not count me as a hardcore fan, I have not read everything else so it was shocking for me to realise that Haldran is Sauron. What a twist for those of us that dont read online theories or have read the books!I could not resist reading a bit online after watching this and it seems like Gandalf does not enter until third age (whilst this is second age) and that the three elves rings were made last and not first.

Good progress.,"This was the culmination of all the slow development. Not one dull moment. The Adar uruk is smart, unlike all other evil lords we know of. He is full of emotions. He is going to be an interesting character. Good action sequences. Even with all the action there were tender moments which clearly contrasted the action but were so delicate. Hope is with the brave. But we tend to shun it sometimes and it leads to the things like guilt and loss. Now we are familiar to the most of characters, the pacing should not dwindle away. The carefully orchestrated plan always work, all we have to do is to have the will to sacrifice for the goal. Uruks (Orcs) have done it for now but the other races not so much. Good visuals. The horses and the sequence of fighting were visually pleasant. Finally good to see Isildur getting close to his father. Also galadriel and halbrand, their chemistry is something to watch. Love to see it. Lets go lets go lets go.",moviesknight,9,0.4431818181818182,No,Udûn,39,88
And so it begins,"What a breath of fresh air compared to all the episodes we have had so far. Im still not sure why we needed 5 episodes of build up for this and lets be honest, all the episodes didnt build up any tension or hype for this episode.I consider this episode from now on as Episode 1 and forget about the horrible previous episodes.In this episode we finally get to see some raw action. There were nice twists and you can now feel where the story is going. The action scenes were nice, gory and beautiful.

Best episode ever in the season,"Spoilers **SO far I am not so much impressed with director choices of elfs with short hair, Galadriel casting. Dwarves was shown good and Orcs are decently good and Awesome visuals with very slow narratingBUT!! Every episode has built up to this episode the way Elf (Arondir) &amp; Villagers made their strategic stand and the then the tide has changed when enemy over smarted them. The Galadriel with Numenors entered to save them making them prisioners itself has impressed me.Well Galadriel entrance could have been better because LOTR/ Habbit movies are knows for the sudden &amp; awesome entries of allies thats a little disappointment but still okay, this is the way director wanted might me.When all this going well, there comes a better twist with an Souron sword activating the tower to release water following through the tunnels/ path digged by Orcs leading to activating an Dormant Volcono....its just MIND BLOWING &amp; AMAZING!!!Now I am vested &amp; interested to check out the next episode.",tejrockz-fca,9,0.48175182481751827,Yes,Udûn,132,274
Best episode thus far.,"Theres no question this week that Rings of Power has delivered an exceptional hour of television. After a couple of slower episodes that meandered from time to time, this was the payoff of all the build up weve had for three weeks now.An amazing battle sequence! Finally! Throughly enjoyed it. The visuals were wonderful to behold. Lots of familiar feelings from watching the Jackson LOTR films came to mind while watching the calvary charging. The cinematography was beautiful, and the director handled the action sequences brilliantly.Beyond the action, the plot was interesting as well, especially concerning Adar. We learn he is one of the first Orcs created and tortured by Morgoth, as well as some more obvious clues to Saurons true identity.The ending alone was worth getting to, as we see the destruction of the Southlands, and the creation of Orodruin (yes thats right, Mt. Doom). It was brutal and beautiful spectacle from start to finish.",alasdairboswell,9,0.5801526717557252,Yes,Udûn,228,393
Here we go!,"I havent minded the series up until now, but I have been yearning for a great fight scene/battle. In this episode we get that and more. I was honestly on the edge of my seat and when I checked the run time expecting the episode to finish there was still 25 minutes left of the episode. The story is still quite messy, with a few plot lines not making much sense and alot of things happen by chance. But Im willing to ignore these negatives with the fight scenses in this episode and some of the choreography. The music was brilliant this episode, it really captured the lord of the rings feelings that the series has missed. The ending was fantastic too, I honestly cant wait until the next episode. 9/10, I hope the next two episodes are as action packed as this one.",aodhanmulholland14,9,0.6240601503759399,No,Udûn,332,532
The ending grows on me...,"The ending grows on me... And so does the whole show. At first I was disappointed Halbrand was Sauron because I had tried too hard to explain away thr mithril story that I thought Sauron was already lurking in the shadows in Eregion, as Annatar. I thought the we die unless mithril was his idea, because it felt so off. I didnt want to believe the rumors though everything pointed that way.But now, after a rewatch and a few days to think about it, I feel differently. Halbrands deception (and Vickers acting) throughout the series has been masterful, and I now see how he uses Galadriel, tricking her in nearly every scene. The acting is phenomenal.My absolute favorite scene in the whole show was when his features changed when he realized Galadriel *knew*. Turning from scruffy Aragorn into sly, cuninng Sauron - without even speaking a word!And then the vision with the raft, following suit! What could have been... how that must have haunted Galadriel throughout her life, even to the extent where she uses his words in the scene with Frodo. It makes a lot of sense.The rest of the scenes in the finale were less interesting to me, and I didnt like the magic staff thing with the Stranger. It felt too much like the LOTR and Hobbit movies, and Im more a book fan.But that said, all the endings had much potential, I think, and I really look forward to season 2 now. :)",jemimahammarlund,9,0.6470588235294118,Yes,Alloyed,11,17
What a spectacular finish,"The whole season has really been very good. They poured all creative talents into the technical aspects and this material is deserving of all the money. But one thing had been missing. Some characters were not relatable and I couldnt get attached to anyone except Nori and Prince Durin. But this episode ties it all for me. Every single person on screen proved their worth and came guns blazing.Sauron takeout, Noris goodbye, Saurons reveal, forging of the first rings are so so well crafted sequence and edited together very nicely.I wish the episode was longer and showed us other characters too. I am also bummed that they couldnt give us one scene of what Earien saw.Background score was something I had complains about too but it was leagues better in this episode.I hope the orcs stop reviewing this and desecrating comments sections so actual fans can enjoy this show as much as movies.",matrixdukenukem,9,0.4592274678111588,No,Alloyed,107,233

There are plenty of characters to unfold. There might still be a chance that we have not seen Sauron yet.

The Beginning Of The End - LOTR: Rings Of Power S01E08 Review,"Were here at last, there and back again, at the final leg of the journey, for season 1 anyway. S01E08 Alloyed in Rings Of Power was a testament to what Amazon could do with one of the biggest pop-culture IPs.Wayne Che Yip did excellent work as director, balancing the many layers and nuances contained in the Rings Of Power finale. Writers Gennifer Hutchison, J. D. Payne, and Patrick McKay scripted a suspenseful and memorable concluding episode. Production design, VFX, and musical scoring were brilliant. Hair-makeup, editing, and costume design were exemplary. Stunts, set decoration, art direction, and sound effects were noteworthy.The Elves residing in Middle-Earth needed Mithril to continue living there, as opposed to others of their kind who enjoyed eternal life in the Grey Havens. All the Rings were someday going to be forged. But plans for the first three were set in motion when Elrond (played by Robert Aramayo) and Lord Celebrimbor (played by Charles Edwards) put their heads together. In their desire to extract Mithril and refresh Elven lifespans, the forge-tower that could match the powers that wrought the Sun was fired up. Near episodes end three rings were made for the Elves.
Morfydd Clark as Galadriel continued to bring an amazing screen presence, and a performance to go with it. The Númenorean King Tar-Palantir, played by Ken Blackburn, finally got abundant lines to deliver this season, and they were impactful. Queen Regent Míriel, played by Cynthia Addai-Robinson, gave a convincing performance since she became blind.Nori Brandyfoot, played by Markella Kavenagh, was inspiring. Poppy Proudfellow, played by Megan Richards, was superb. Sadoc Burrows, played by Lenny Henry, gave a heart-wrenching performance. Marigold Brandyfoot, played by Sara Zwangobani, was quite good. Largo Brandyfoot, played by Dylan Smith, was amazing.The Dweller (played by Bridie Sisson), the Ascetic (played by Kali Kopae), and the Nomad (played by Edith Poor) began the episode with a grand announcement, of sorts. All three gave great performances. One of the most astounding revelations in this episode soon followed, focused around the Stranger (played by Daniel Weyman).He was indeed a wizard, the one and only Gandalf. From his dialogues to his powerplay moments, everything about the confirmation of Gandalf in this epi was enchanting. We also heard the so-called witches say Istar - a version of Istari or Wise One, part of the longer Heren Istarion aka the Order of Wizards - further entrenching the fact that Gandalf and the Stranger were one and the same.Canonically speaking the Grey Wizard was not supposed to have been around during the Rings Of Power timeline. According to Tolkiens original lore, wizards like Gandalf and Saruman didnt even arrive in Middle-earth until the Third Age. Seeing as how the events in Rings of Power took place in the Second Age, this was clearly an intentional time-twist on the part of the show-writers, and a welcome one at that. I got goosebumps the moment young Gandalf turned to Nori and said, When in doubt...always follow your nose.
Now, about Halbrand (played by Charlie Vickers). The man - or should I say, Elf - needs special elaboration here. In my reviews for episodes 4 and 6, I wrote the following lines about him:They also played Halbrands cards close to their chest. His Hulk smash style super-strength in episode 3 was apparently a key element to be explored as the show progressed and not to be revealed too soon.
Also, the way Halbrand brought down Adars horse without harming the animal hinted at a special je ne sais quoi, which we may learn the (skilled technique) origins of in a future episode. In this one, he reluctantly reclaimed his role as the true king of the Southlands.Seems to me that despite his early inability to maintain control over his illusion and his apparent use of an ancient Elven (?) horsemanship technique, Saurons shape-shifted disguise as Halbrand successfully did not give him away all season. Now I think back on it, the foreshadowing was there yet none of the exposés.Halbrand apparently used Galadriel from the beginning. In the previous episode, he faked an injury that needed Elvish medicine, knowing deep down that Galadriel would take him to the nearest Elven city in Middle-Earth, namely Eregion, thus inadvertently granting Halbrand access to Celebrimbor and his legendary workshop.The whole affair was beautifully orchestrated, and in keeping with Tolkiens lore where it stated that Sauron was shape-shifted at the time he learned the craft, directly from Celebrimbor I may add, that would later help him forge the One Ring of Power. A non-canonical character therefore became one of the most significant canonical characters in the franchise. Well played, Amazon Studios, and well hidden.Season 2 Rings Of Power thus established the coming of the villain who has always remained vital to the Lord of the Rings and related story arcs forged by J. R. R. Tolkien. All hail the Dark Lord, indeed.Other cast and crew members did superb work in the season finale of Rings of Power now streaming on Amazon Prime.After learning what he needed, Halbrand-Sauron was headed to Mordor, toward Mount Doom to be precise, in a scene that gave me chills. The Elves found hope in Mithril and the Rings, but a new darkness will certainly be coming from the former Southlands.Gandalf and Nori were off on a journey of discovery. The Harfoots were in a place that looked a lot like the Shire. A political gear-change was imminent in Númenor.Galadriels role in the series going forward became of utmost importance. Elronds further contribution, and that of the dwarves, was definitely on the way - Rivendell, Moria, that Balrog, were all open for world-building and unleashing in S02.The next season of Rings Of Power is going to be lit, and not necessarily in a benign way. And so begins the next longest wait for fans of the Lord of the Rings franchise.*** *** ***The Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little, and it will fail, to the ruin of all.

Best episode of the S01,"Brilliant. The best episode of the series has to be the final one. Not a dull moment. The game of who is sauron, all of them are sauron was really wild in this episode. The reveal was well played. It was one of the important things to keep the conversation flowing outside of the episodes. Galadriel is his only and biggest opposition. Harfoots show a braver heart. The stranger reveal was well played. The reverse reveal was fantastic. Always believed in him to be on the good side. The scene with galadriel and halbrand was the best one, both with respect to visuals, dialogues, and its importance to the series. The characters they play and the implications on the middle earth, this trope is what I live for. More of this please. Now, towards Elrond, he is wiser and important, he says more with less. The sacrifice has to be there for the greater good. No matter the cost. Also, it is really evil and intelligent for them to show us that last scene of mount doom with sauron, leaving us wait for another season. The song of rings at the end was the cherry on cake. Also like it the way it was played, reminded me of the song, The house of rising sun from the film the endless. Perfect ending to the show and leaving on the cliffhanger.

My friend had said the series wasnt as dark as the movies, but here it started to feel like the Lord of the Rings.Having finished it, it feels like the first season was a teaser.

Fantastic ending,"This first season has overall been of high quality.

This was as true for the last episode, as for the whole season.The review bombing is clearly politically motivated, it does not make any sense that this series has so many 1/10.I was a tad annoyed with Elronds incapacity to actually run when in a hurry, but other than that this episode itched all the right spots for me 😊",oskar-solbraekke,9,0.2222222222222222,No,Alloyed,6,27

After all the films that we watched we still know nothing about this world just a drop of water and this era is really complicated and has a nice column to stand and start a new amazing tale about the rings. Characters are great so many lines but every one has its advantages and interesting things to follow. The opening scene including the short scenes of war against Morgoth were masterpieces with dragons fight shot are the best. The cinematography was a main member in this show many sets but the quality is in the top that is really challenging one the question is this the best cinematography we see it until now. The dialogues between characters helped a lot to build the story aim. The middle eath in the second era designed very well and convince me the visual effects is now the bar to any series .One hour full of everything and epic songs . Good job Amazon keep like this and this show will be a legend and a landmark years and decades hop the rest is more and more better.,mathewgamal,10,0.2011173184357542,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,36,179
Show with time was going to get more intense.,"I understand the complaints of the users to the first, second or even third episode. But if even after the fifth you continue to watch the series and come to complain here, yours is no longer disgust for a bad production, but simple sabotaging of the series ranking. I had great faith that this episode was going to continue from start and take off to finally start the knot at the beginning. The series started slowly, almost 4 introductory chapters and without action but they were extremely necessary to contextualize the scenery, the plot and the direction of the argumentative arc of each character. I really liked in this episode how the personality traits are more marked and a small appetizer of the abilities that each character has.",cjmejiab,10,0.32432432432432434,No,Partings,12,37
epic; true LOTR atmosphere & feeling,"The script &amp; dialogue was much better in this episode, itll probably be the highest rated thus far.The visuals are stunning (including an explosions) and so is the music.Finally we get a hobbit type song and its so good. Im very happy to see more Harfoots.We get more dwarves &amp; elves in this episode.More fighting, magic, artifacts, lore, and random forging of weapons.Its still a mystery who is Sauron, who the meteor man is, and what the mystery blade is.Another mystery: Were introduced to trio who say nothing, and inspecting the meteor mans impact crater, why, idk, it lasts for a brief scene.",provoko-67847,10,0.2671232876712329,No,Partings,39,146
God Finally Finally,"Let me start with the overview this is by far the best episode and it clearly gave Lord Of The Rings Vibes
that we all been missing
The episode is amazing and eye pleasing
Infact what I loved the most is the screenplay it is 10x better than last few episodes and now we clearly know where this show is heading
Although there are few problems to address too like they are revealing too little and we want to know more about the Mysterious man and what is he doing
I know just to make multi season show the storys pace is little slow.Overall I would say this what we always wanted and I cant wait for seven more days.",souravvxyz,10,0.3087248322147651,No,Partings,46,149
My flame for Lord of the Rings has resparked,"Just seeing the first 20 minutes of this episode, really brought me back to the time that Lord of the Rings was everything to me.This show gets allot of hate because it tries to appeal to a new generation. If u look behind the short haired elves and beardless dwarfs.. it still upholds everything i held dear at the time i was young, watching the first movies.The songs of the harfoots. The panoramic shots of the amazing landscapes. The cultural differences between the races where each upholds their own intersts to gain power. The imminent threat and hoplessnes growing while everything seams hopeless but light still shining in the dark...I think Tolkien would be proud that a new generation gets to experience the legacy he created.Change is painfull because we all uphold Tolkien in a sacred place in our hearts, but its deffinitly not the monstrosity people made this show out to be!",vincent_rommens,10,0.29120879120879123,No,Partings,106,364
Talent pays off,"Absolutely amazing first episode. Well Produced in similar flair and atmosphere as the lord of the rings trilogy and good convincing performance of the quite talented cast. The dialogues were intriguing and well fitting to the LOTR world. Costumes are nicely done as well. My absolute favourite highlight of the episode however is the troll scene. The fight between the troll and Galadriel was absolutely amazing and well performed. It contained the kind of movements and smoothness I would expect to see from an elf and more without repeating the fighting scenes of the past movies. So very well done here, 10 in originality and 10 in performance.",daphnewauben,10,0.0,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,0,4
"Fantastic, Incredible music and imagery","Im here for the Goosebumps!Wonderful imagery, storytelling and music. Even though it is more of a saga so far and less raw than the LOTR movies, and differs from the original Tolkien writings(which even LOTR did BTW), I feel like it still delivers a true Middle Earth experience with the same world, imagery, ideas and cultural differences as I grew up to love. I love especially the music since it isnt a copy of the LOTR score but still has a similar feeling. Screw the criticism and just enjoy a good, EXPENSIVE show! If Id want to criticize I could but Id rather go on an adventure and see where this goes.Im hooked and I want to be./A child in a young mans body, who grew up slaying orcs in the woods and reading LOTR, Silmarillion, and Bilbo.",meydiana-65242,10,0.25,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,4
A shadow of the past and you will fall in love with it,"So The Rings of Power has finally arrived! As a result episode 1 in particular, and to a lesser extent episode 2, is all about world-building. We meet five different cultures from four different peoples over the course of these two episodes; Ñoldorian Elves, Silvan Elves, (Wo)Men of the Southlands, Harfoots, and Dwarves. Each are distinguished by height (of course), ears, costume, and accent - Elves speak in whats officially known as Received Pronunciation, or unofficially as posh English accent, Dwarves follow John Rhys Davies example from The Lord of the Rings and have Scottish accents, Harfoots all have Southern Irish accents, and confusingly, Men from the Southlands have Northern English accents, presumably inspired by the Starks of Winterfell. The Ñoldorian Elves - Galadriel (Morfyyd Clark), Gil-galad (Benjamin Walker), and Elrond (Robert Aramayo) - are probably the closest to what we were all expecting. Since Elves dont age, these are literally the same characters we meet hundreds of years later in The Lord of the Rings, so naturally their clothing, accents, culture and so on more or less match what we know from the later stories. The Silvan Elves are a bit more interesting. Arondir (Ismael Cruz Córdova) and his companions are a colonizing force, occupying the Southlands. They express views often common among colonizing powers, believing they have conquered these people for their own good, that they are inherently better than the Men they rule, and so on. Arondir is directly referred to as a soldier, and he has a uniform, a commanding officer, and talks about being stationed there, so that all in all these Elves give off more of an earthy, Ancient Roman vibe than were used to seeing from these usually ethereal creatures. Its a refreshing change and opens up some really interesting story possibilities, especially since Arondir is in love with the Human woman. This younger Galadriel is from the start quite different from the character played by Cate Blanchett in Peter Jacksons movies. Of course shes younger, but with youth comes a sharp tongue and rebellious spirit that drive her to take her company to the literal ends of the Earth in her quest for Orcs and their new leader. In the Southlands, a land of men, the elves who were watching over them (protecting them from Morgoth ad the Orcs) are finally allowed to return home, forcing Arondir (Ismael Cruz Córdova) to say goodbye to Bronwyn (Nazanin Boniadi), a human healer for whom he has feelings despite their two species not necessarily seeing eye to eye. However, their separation is short-lived. After the discovery of a disturbingly sick cow, they venture to a nearby village, finding it absolutely destroyed as an indication that the evil isnt gone. And in Bronwyns home village, there are signs of danger when her son Theo (Tyroe Muhafidin), reveals a kilt engraved with Saurons symbol.",goshamorrell,10,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,1,2
Peter Jackson is needed....,"As a LOTR fan and a reader, Im not so impressed with this. Btw as a tv show lover, I can give 10/10 for this. But this seems they are going to spoil the Tolkien universe if they continue some actions. At least the basics of the Tolkien universe should be included. Most when you think about elves, they should look like elves, not men ( Im not talking about the black elf). So do the basics. If not this series will fail among Lotr fans.I think Peter Jackson is the one who deserves to make this He did his research before jumping on it, thats why lotr was the best trio ever.The quality of CGI, VFX, SFX, and cinematography is at the top level. But in a tv series, there is nothing without a good story, in this tv show the story is also ok for me. But the production team should focus on that part of what I was talking about. I know they are doing this work with Tolkien scholars. But think more about this, this is not GOT, This is a legendary creation so there are lots of people in the world who always live in this Tolkien universe. As I think PJ really got the idea of how to do this.",wihangasihilel,10,0.1721311475409836,No,A Shadow of the Past,21,122
My take - other than my nitpicks I love it,"Ignore most of the reviews you may read below down to the fact half or more havent even streamed the episode yet, and is based on premature feelings they had when watching the trailers.I myself went to a special event based in Cardiff with a friend, and was blown away in the first 6 minutes.People still have the trilogy if they dont like this show, but you need to go into this show open minded, dont expect Peter Jacksons world, give it time to open up, and if you dont like it, you gave it a shot. Tolkiens work will always be difficult to adapt to screen.It has many positives and negatives in the first two episodes,
Lets get some of them out the wayNegatives - these are minor nitpicks
Meteor man didnt do it for me, although I did like the inclusion of harfoots.The scene with Galadriel and Hal brand was extremely boring and pointless, holding the rope not doing a single useful thing with it, didnt add anything to the scene.The love story building up between Arondir and Bronwen, not a fan of this either.The scene with Galadriel and Elrond, was one of my faves so far and Kazadum.",lukejenks-07774,10,0.1732283464566929,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,22,127
Beautiful and sprawling prologue,"The premier is stunning visually as is to be expected. It lives in the same world as other LotR stories but also feels unique. The dialogue is poetic for the elves, and more prose for the hobbits. Theyve built upon lore to make a lived-in world with loads of charm and interesting characters without being constricted by purism (racism). More viewers will finally see themselves reflected in this series and it makes it all the more interesting. The music is stunning, the costumes are detailed and thematic based on the races. The sets are huge and often practical. Notice that many of the negative reviews not have anything specific to say that actually makes sense. Its impressive in every way and I cant wait to see where it goes.",sammysamo-279-385568,10,0.2413793103448276,No,A Shadow of the Past,7,29
A new era begins,As a LOTR Peter Jackson fan I should stand up and clap for this episodeIve never seen visuals effects like this omgThe cinematography is flawlessAbsolutely worth watching.I hope the rest of the show comes amazing as Tolkien hoped.From what I can feel I hope this show made a great step in tv history.Speak about the effects its truly worth the budget we all know how crazy the budget is in this show and I am so excited to see the rest.To be honest I feel sorta disagreement between the Peter Jackson movies and this show but I hope it doesnt affect this show in the future.I love Tolkien and his books and I wish this show be a great part of tv history.,Moah-505q,10,0.42857142857142855,No,A Shadow of the Past,6,14
An incredible beginning!,"Rings of Power (RoP) starts very much like LOTR fellowship of the rings, instead of a war with Sauron, we get to see a war with Morgoth.Visuals, music, and locations bring you back into the LOTR atmosphere.A lot of characters, lore, races/monsters, artifacts are introduced, but is similar to how the movies introduce characters and side stories.Stay away from the criticism and just get into the lore, theres just so much you can do with this world and Im so happy they made a series around the LOTR.You can learn about all the terms by checking out the one wiki to rule them all wiki which is a good source.",provoko-67847,10,0.6666666666666666,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,3

the story now became after 3 episodes
I think the orcs are very much better than hobbit series not maybe better than the original seriesthere are a wonderful eye catching woods and mine and city... Its nice to be in middle earth again I love it.At first its troubling that lady of light is so alone and non a great witch but its almost beginning of time and she is young... Maybe just maybe we see how she becomes a powerful witch than she can stand against Sauron himself...

Great set up,"Needless to say the production value is probably as high as its gonna get for any TV show. I was not expecting to like the Harfoots as they dont play a role in the second age, but somehow they turned out to be my favorite thing so far. Its unfortunate that they couldnt name drop that Galadriel was playing with the sons of Feanor, and but the bullying nicely foreshadowed the Kin-Slaying without kitting into a rights issue. It was slowish, but Tolkien is notoriously slow.As far as lore and cannon, I was expecting a dumpster fire, but it wasnt.. so Im pleasantly surprised, thats not to say that it is lore accurate at all. Im gonna enjoy this the same way I emptied the shadow of war games that were weak of the lore, but fun as hell.Id give this a solid 7.5.",aeldin,10,0.24774774774774774,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,55,222
Most epic of tv shows,"The feeling I got watching this is the same one i got when first viewing The Lord of The Rings.It has been a long time since I got goosebumps from watching tv or cinema but this show is really epic. The production is on par with the most expensive epic summer blockbuster.There are multiple storylines to follow, this can be a bit overwhelming at first. But the cast is great. And they are all memorable and interesting in their own ways.We can finally see what the world looked like when it was in its most advanced stages. From cities of elves to great halls of dwarven kingdoms, it all looks and feels spectacular.10 from me.P.s They bombed the rating for now good reason, this i easy the best show at the moment.",dusan-czh,10,0.4444444444444444,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,9
Impressive after all,"Most people may think that they rewatch Lotr for the first time. But it will never be again the first time, watching the greatest movies of our time.But, as we can tell after two episodes, The Rings of power will do its verry best to tell not only a new story, with old and new names on the screen, but also to look verry beautiful detailed and with a lot of soul in it. The feeling as if they did really hard work.Sure some of the dialogues may be kind of hollow, but not all of them, and there is jet more to come. As harcore Lotr fan, knowing the happenings of all ages middle earth has seen, it is just fantastic to be back in this world, hoping they keep it on that level.",tonibrucker,10,0.4444444444444444,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,9
Ignore the Boomers,"The show is amazing. Visuals,sounds and the atmosphere,art style is great,what do you expect more?If you give this show a 1 or 2 stars you are not realistic and being a cry baby.Only con is for me fighting scenes ,it can be more realistic.I am gonna buy a new tv just for this show because visualization is so mesmerizing.Dont listen to the negative reviews. Some people have an idea of what something should be in their own mind.And of course it is better than GoT :)Also keep in mind when you have a big unrealistic expectations nothing is gonna satisfy you,even if Tolkien come back to life and keep his identify anonim and directed it you wouldnt like because of your unrealistic expectations.",prettycolorlesss,10,0.375,No,A Shadow of the Past,3,8
Captivating 👑,"Quick review of #RingsofPowerOnly two episodes so far, but what a show! Cinematography is aptly cinematic, music is moving especially Valinor, cant wait to hear more. Loved the exposition in episode one, and I was engrossed in episode two, which I hope they would continue to flesh these threads further along. Character performances are great, and Id name Elrond &amp; Galadriel, Durin and Disa, Poppy and Nori.Absolute scene-stealers: the Stranger &amp; fireflies, Elves &amp; sculpted statues of the fallen, the looming Numinorian, the grandiosity of the sea and Worm, and the Two Trees.Things to wonder about: Theo and Blade, Steanger and mystery power!",tagreedeng,10,0.23225806451612904,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,36,155
Be prepared because we are ready to fight in Middle Earth!!!,"Well I really liked the previous four episodes, the show is visually stunning and the basic elements of a journey that will last 50 episodes are set.But 5 was outstanding, it was like saying ok now we have all the elements in place and we are going to a very specific place, you are not lost anymoreGaladriel is shining in this one, she is a hero, powerful but having tragic elements in here past. Not very conviced at the beginning but she totally got me in this one. Halbrand also is quite a character and all the Numenor arc line seems way more satisfactory now. My second favourite part is the quest for mithril by Elrond and his relationship with Durin. Funny, but very relevant for the future of their races. I also really liked to see how the frienship develops in this one.The stranger after this one maybe change a bit my theory and this man could be more like a dark character. I was thinking him to be a blue wizard but now I have my doubts. Room for improvement for Harfoots journey, I want more relevance from them. Also I liked Arondir and Bronwyn arc, it is important as they are in front line now, but I expect more from them too.Very satisfied at this point, chapter 4 was my lowest rated and generated some doubts but this one got me totally onboard again.",Morganv2prime,10,0.3103448275862069,Yes,Partings,9,29
This looks SOLID 👍🏻,"I just watched the first episode of The Rings Of Power and I must admit that this first episode gave me the chills to the bone. And Id also like to say that this is how a promising fantasy adventure series should start. Im so excited to see the rest of the episodes of this series.The visuals are awe inspiring. Even some of the scenes reminded me of the Lord of the rings. This was just the beginning and I can tell you one thing for sure that.this series is gonna outrun the House Of The Dragon without any doubt.

I feel like I got lucky to go to Middle Earth again❤❤ The visual effects are at the highest level. In a high quality that is not even seen in the movies. And you can see a very wide world. This is a good opportunity for those who have been unable to watch a good fantasy series for a long time. Looking forward to what comes next. Every character in the story has been given a maximum performance. There were places where I thought it would have been better if the way the story flowed was a little more descriptive. I think it would be better if some things were shown without saying.

Great amazing show,I love how they tried to keep the costumes and makeup close to the original movies. No it doesnt match exactly but it is set in a earlier time and Im sure that style and clothes changed through the ages just like it does for us. The show is great please dont stop writing. I think they have done a great job easing us into the story and giving us little pieces of information to go with the Lord of the rings and the Hobbit. This show has the following and literature to have people talking about different parts of middle earth just like people do star wars. I see this show creating a whole new world and probably the relaunch of the trilogies along with details about things that arent in the books or movies.,tonyljones-80425,10,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,2,4
Fantastic,"What an incredible first episode! Loved the story, the characters, the soundtrack, the visuals... everything. I cant wait to keep watching. This series clearly pays homage to the original trilogy by Peter Jackson, but it also has a flair of its own. This is the prequel to rule them all. Thank you, Tolkien, for conjuring up such an amazing universe. Being a huge fan, the first episode has surpassed all my expectations. The fist episode alone is than 99% of any tv or movies out there.

But just like 20 years ago - I DONT CARE! - I boarded and let myself go.I really enjoyed these first 2 episodes.The actors performance are great as is the characterization of the mystical environment of the Middle Earth.And the new plot aspects creators for the series are well engineered so to not deviate from what is already established in Tolkiens legendarium.",KzArashi,10,0.34285714285714286,No,A Shadow of the Past,12,35
Best episode yet,"And so we cross the halfway point of the most expensive TV show ever made with the plot finally starting to move forward. I know I keep mentioning the budget and the money poured into this, which is partly why Im so critical of how poorly written this is. $1 billion spent and Amazon couldnt bring excellent writers onboard? The Harfoot story in particular is really poor, and morally these folk are absolutely barbaric and murderous. Not only are they happy to leave their own behind, they also conspire to sabotage their own too. So much for being a happy-go-lucky bunch of nomadic folk! And worse, their story does nothing but introduce a mystery box in the form of the stranger who could well prove to be Gandalf. But despite whoever this guy is, its nowhere near interesting enough to sustain the show moving forward. Mystery Box plot mechanics arent necessarily bad but given this is a prequel to a well-known story, these mysteries are pointless and show a distinct lack of writing prowess from those at the helm of this ship. The mystery surrounding who Sauron is, for example, is painfully orchestrated from the beginning and that touching of arms between Galadriel and Halbrand at the end appears to seal the deal. Its got to be him, surely! Speaking of Galadriel, what a difference a day makes, eh? Last week we had elves are taking our jobs and this week we have everyone applauding and fawning over the little Mary Sue. And as always, Galadriel is as insufferable as she is terribly written. From her constant scowling face and scathing put-downs to everyone around her, all the way across to her non-existent flaws and flatlined character arc, everything about this character is so poorly done. The best part of Rings of Power though is that of the Elves and Dwarves. In fact, Disa and Durin are probably the best characters in the entire series but theyre sorely lacking here. Their fun banter and charisma is just what this show needs, in whats otherwise a very dour and mediocre-at-best fantasy fluff piece. Hopefully the upcoming episodes can improve but it seems doubtful at this point.",goshamorrell,10,0.0,No,Partings,0,1
Yessssss! This is what Im here for,"This is really getting going now. I am very invested in the characters and the plot, they are starting to feel really fleshed out.

I cant wait for the next episode!Galadriel in particular is starting to feel fully realized. Also, loving the queen and orc leader, I want to know
more about them. Not much about the Harfoots in this episode, and they may be the weakest part of the story so far. Hopefully, their plot will start to get more intriguing.",aquarianavenger,10,0.27672955974842767,No,The Great Wave,44,159
Loved it!,"First of all, the song was amazing!Then all the mysteries, the speeches. It is the first time I feel like Tolkien could have written this. The humour of Durin and Elrond was my favourite part, but Gil Galad annoyed me as most high-elves do. I was very interested in the people of Ostirith and those who decided to follow Adar. Is he Sauron? It certainly seemed so, but then, the doubt came. And also, those people searching for the stranger...is him Sauron?I am not inlove with all the acting, but I think Elendil, Adar, the Stranger, Durin and Elrond, and most of the hobits are doing a great job. I think the show is a slow burning, but I am loving it now.",pauli_gomez,10,0.0,Yes,Partings,0,7
Better than the first two episodes,"The storyline starts getting clearer in this episode. It is way better than the first two. Im glad I continued watching the show.

step by step,"Things getting more clear now... a great story taking shape, and you cant judge a book by its cover.This is not a movie after all, just step by step, I dont understand why the rush from reviewers complaining about the large amount of characters, the fellowship of the rings which has 9+ main characters, and all the world loved that in a 3 hours movie.The visuals are great, acting is good with more dialogue details as expected for a series.Id say more action and small fights will be taking place after episode 6 up to the final, and hopefully to see the chain connected more with the original films, which we can say its the foundation of the success.The lord of the rings series is a world wide success on that time, no one can expected to see such things again, or even a remake in the next 10 to 20 years, it has its time and circumstances.Even for the video games created for the LOTR, all focusing on the third age, this is different.I do respect Amazon choice for prequel, but sticking with the original story is wise, with respect to Tolkens legacy which seems that fans are annoyed and putting bad reviews on this.Cant wait for more, give it time, or let time tells.",UncleBashar,10,0.43243243243243246,No,Adar,16,37
This show is not bad its physically and emotionally amazing and is a masterpiece,"So how did Galadriel and the others survive a pyroclastic flow last week? Was it a vision? Elvish magic? Nope, it was just... bad writing. Its not even explained. Its one of the most frustrating things with this show and its shocking how bad the writing is. Given the sheer amount of money thats been spent on this project, the screenplay is absolutely atrocious. To make it worse, theres absolutely no consequences for anything. Sure, the visuals are good but at the same time some of these interior sets and costume designs look awful. Weve already seen the show copy and paste in extras rather than actually hiring more people, while the choreography and battle scenes leave a lot to be desired. Episode 7 of Rings of Power starts with Galadriel and the others surviving a pyroclastic flow. How? Dont ask questions, just consume product, thats how! A flaming horse gallops past, while Galadriel finds Theo absolutely fine, while most of the structures in the village are still intact. So with all the survivors together, they head off in search of salvation. The psychotic Harfoots decide to get the Stranger to try and fix whats happening to their world. When a tree falls on Nori, theyre lucky shes not hurt because as we know, the Harfoots will just leave their wounded behind. Anyway, The Strangers magic seems to have worked, as the trees begin sprouting masses of food that they greedily harvest. However, the Harfoots arent alone. Theyre being watched by that mysterious trio we saw last week. They silently head off but Nori decides to stop them. Thats a bad move, as the leader sets fire to their caravan and burns everything, food included. As a result, they decide to follow Nori, although Sardoc is convinced this is a bad move. Elrond asks for access to the Mithril mines from King Durin III, offering up to furnish the city with game, grain and timber from the elder forests for the next five centuries. I mean, thats a long period of time and with Elrond dropping to his knees, he pleads with the King of the dwarves for help in this endeavour. Disa though is not happy and believes they should reopen the mines themselves and see if theres a safe way of mining mithril. When Durin slides a piece of mithril across the table, it ends up next to the infected leaf and seems to heal it. So Elrond and Prince Durin begin mining mithril together, and theres some lovely banter between them. Honestly, these two and Disa are the best parts of the show. When King Durin sees his son in the mines, the pair have a pretty fiery chat. These scenes end with that aforementioned leaf floating down the recesses of the mines where it happens upon a mighty balrog.",goshamorrell,10,0.0,No,The Eye,0,2
Eps 8 - The Eye does not dissapoint,"Beware of haters from Mordor!In Rings of Power, just the way they captured the life and times of disparate races - Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Orcs - and creatures galore from Tolkiens literary Second Age of Middle-Earth was a testament to the screenplay writers sheer determination to make this series a resounding success.I loved every frame, and am now surprisingly confused about which scene I should start praising. As with most breathtaking undertakings of this kind, I shall endeavor to start at the very beginning. The creation myth Tolkien crafted in his book The Silmarillion found admirable translation in Rings of Power.Episodes 1 and 2, namely A Shadow of the Past and Adrift respectively, were directed by J. A. Bayona, who brought excellence to bear on each frame. Writers J. D.

The production design and editing teams deserve their weight in gold for their work in helping bring this story to life. The art direction and set decoration teams did superb work. Hair-makeup, sound effects, and stunts were outstanding. Kate Hawleys costume design was exemplary - every stitch and hem was on point.As for the CGI and VFX teams, they were the de facto hobbits from the Aragorn-crowned scene in Return of the King. According to Variety, they used 20 VFX studios, nearly 10,000 VFX shots to revive Middle-earth. This crew certainly bows to no-one but we shall bow to them.Galadriel, played by Morfydd Clark, was outstanding - her performance redefined so much about this iconic and inspiring character. In just two episodes, Clark proved to be the Wonder Woman of the Tolkien-verse. Her acting also paid due homage to Cate Blanchetts take on the character.As for Sauron, he is a particularly significant character in the Tolkien-verse. In connection to him, we are yet to see what actor Bridie Sisson will be bringing to the series. Perhaps some sort of religious devotee or ritual summoner? Sisson lived up to that aura, as witnessed in the trailer. Future epis may reveal Saurons true identity.Poppy Proudfellow, played by Megan Richards, was remarkable. Elanor Nori Brandyfoot, played by Markella Kavenagh, was great. Some new Frodo and Sam vibes with those two, only Harfoots instead of Hobbits.The stranger, potentially Gandalf (!), played by Daniel Weyman, was intriguing - his performance was rife with mystery and magic.

Story is slow but,"After the storm in last episode, this episode is relatively very calm. But lot of happenings.Firstly stranger leaves the harfoots, who was chased by annatar and 2 others. The storyline of dwarf kingdom was excellent. Feeling sad that a prosperous dwarves kingdom will become ruins once balrog is out. I was surprised that dwarves kingdom was so much prosperous before the events of lord of the rings. The southlands is converted to mordor and became home of orcs. Now we can see orcs gaining strength, which were weaker in earlier episodes. The massive orcs we saw in lord of the rings are about to come. I like adar as a whole, he has typical villain attitude, he helped to fill the gap till sauron makes entry officially. But I want adar to continue.Story is going at a steady pace.

"Incredible episode, I actually clapped.","The last two episodes have been sublime.Last week showed us they could do incredible stakes and not shy away from showing real darkness.This week was a master class of moving character scenes that had been built on the foundations laid over the rest of the season. There were about 5 scenes it could have ended on, and still been a great episode, but they kept coming!The scenes with Durin and his father, and Durin and Elrond, were particularly moving.I just adore the Harfoots too. I was really skeptical of having Hobbits in the show, but they showed them in all the glorious courage and innocence that Tolkien invested them with.Its looking to be my favourite show since the Battlestar Galactica reboot all those years ago, and potentially ecipse the Peter Jackson movies.I have read LotR, the Silmirillion, and some of the history of Middle Earth books since I was a a teenager in the 90s, and I love the way they are developing this mythos. I like how it is not slavish to what little is known of the Second Age, and has included new aspects and real suprprises that fit in with the spirit of Tolkiens work.

Step by step,"Things getting more clear now... a great story taking shape, and you cant judge a book by its cover.This is not a movie after all, just step by step, I dont understand why the rush from reviewers complaining about the large amount of characters, the fellowship of the rings which has 9+ main characters, and all the world loved that in a 3 hours movie.The visuals are great, acting is good with more dialogue details as expected for a series.Id say more action and small fights will be taking place after episode 6 up to the final, and hopefully to see the chain connected more with the original films, which we can say its the foundation of the success.The lord of the rings series is a world wide success on that time, no one can expected to see such things again, or even a remake in the next 10 to 20 years, it has its time and circumstances.Even for the video games created for the LOTR, all focusing on the third age, this is different.I do respect Amazon choice for prequel, but sticking with the original story is wise, with respect to Tolkens legacy which seems that fans are annoyed and putting bad reviews on this.Cant wait for more, give it time, or let time tells.",meydiana-65242,10,0.0,No,Adar,0,1
Morfydd Clark leads a powerful opening salvo for Rings of Power,"I had my doubts. I really did. I am an avid Tolkien fan, and approached this series with some trepidation (though not the irrational hate that I saw from some others).Some slightly dodgy Irish accents aside (Im Irish, for what its worth), this was a wonderful opening episode, with a standout performance from Morfydd Clark as Galadriel (and I say that as someone who felt that Cate Blanchetts performance was nigh impossible to match).This, to me, captured the Biblical feel of The Silmarillion (even though it barely touches on those events and instead focuses on a understandably time-compressed renedition of major Second Age events). The closing scene, in particular, was both beautiful and powerful -- and I really wanted to watch more.Overall, the writing is very good, the dialogue is mostly excellent, and the acting is good to great. The visuals are spectacular. The ideas are familiar in places and fresh in others. The soundtrack hits all the right notes. Nothing about this is mediocre. While its different tonally to the Lord of the Rings movies (it has to be, as its a very different time period, and a very different story), it gives hope that the rest of the series will actually live up to the promise and do justice to Tolkiens work. If nothing else, this will show people that there is more to the Professors mythos than the events of the late Third Age.Quite frankly, the lore issues are more minimal than many made out. We could split hairs over how many whiskers Disa should have on her chin, but the reality is she delivers as a female dwarf in a really likeable way. We could spend all day debating whether there should be two Durins alive at the same time, but we would be fools to think that time compression wouldnt be used in an adaptation of a story spanning almost three and a half thousand years.If youre in doubt, watch it and judge for yourself. Go in with an open mind and give it the chance it deserves. Find fault if you will, sure, but let people find joy if they will too.",deanfwilson,10,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,8

After the 4th episode, we already have evil powers properly arranged for attack, here is Galadriel with fleet and Isildur coming back to Middle Earth, Durins gonna visit Lindon after fathers permission and meanwhile, there are vulnerable people stayed without protection against Orcs fathers agression.So here is a whole story prepared, which is very promising.

Nothing you can hate about this show,"Episode 4 of The Rings of Power starts with us at Minas Tirith. Sorry, the palace at Numenor. Queen Regent Miriel dreams of a massive flood washing over and destroying everything before awakening with a start. Out in the streets, Tamar gives a big speech to the people about the dangers of Elves taking their jobs. Is this an allegory? You betcha! The same sort of allegory that Tolkien despised, which he wrote about in several letters. The flippant comment from Elrond, claiming that its been 20 years since he last saw Durin who perfectly exemplifies some of the lackadaisical worldbuilding at work here. Are Elrond and Durin in a different timeline to everyone else? We get no Harfoots this time around which may actually be a small mercy given their story hasnt really added anything. In fact, it seems Amazon even know this given there have been articles recently asking people to have faith as Galadriel is on a journey of humility. But we see none of that here. Instead, we get an eyerolling scene of Galadriel single-handedly stopping 5 fully armoured and strong Numenorian guards without a weapon or armour herself, pushing them all effortlessly into a jail cell without breaking a sweat. Were now halfway through this season, with 4 hours of content having passed us by. So far, weve advanced very little of the plot and this is moving at a glacial pace. Will the second half of this pick up the pace? Will we see some advancement of the story? As the Numenorians disdain at the idea of their Queen being in collusion with elves, Pharazon shows up and reassures them, reminding the group that this will remain a Kingdom of Men, not of Elves. He also offers them a whole bunch of drinks to quell the mood. Galadriel returns to Miriel and points out that Halbrand (aka. Evil Aragorn) is the lost heir in exile to the throne of the Southlands. Of course Miriel doesnt believe her, but Galadriel is persistent, pointing out they should fight together to save the people of the Southlands before Sauron strikes. Miriel rejects this again, until Galadriel decides to steamroll over the Queen Regent, pointing out she has a tempest in her and it brought her to Numenor. After threatening the queen, Galadriel is predictably put behind bars. What wonderful negotiation skills this wise elf has!",goshamorrell,10,0.0,No,The Great Wave,0,1
This show is the best since Game of Thrones,"The Rings of Power episode 3 largely continues in the same vein as episodes 1 and 2. Its stunningly beautiful (Orcs excepted), well acted, and continues to feel very much like part of the world we saw in Peter Jacksons movies based on Tolkiens works. But it is also rather slow-paced and weighed down by the need for substantial amounts of exposition. The Númenoreans themselves are an interesting group. All of them except for Elendils daughter Eärien are Tolkien characters (not new characters written for the series), though the show has added a couple of titles to make their position clear - Míriel becoming officially Regent while her father spends his time up in a tower, and Pharazôn is referred to as Chancellor Pharazôn. Although Míriels dislike and fear of the Elf is a bit strange, as Míriels father was a big fan of Elves, otherwise this story seems to be following Tolkiens outline more closely than anything else weve seen in the series (and, interestingly, its using a bit more information gleaned from The Silmarillion - weve written in the past about the complicated legal situation there). For fans who enjoy seeing screen adaptations that stay closer to the books, this will almost certainly be their favourite storyline. It takes the episode a while to check in with the Harfoots, but when it does, we learn a bit more about their culture as well - and it is brutal! Apparently, the Harfoots are extremely ableist and although they proudly proclaim nobody walks alone, anyone who cannot walk gets abandoned as one of the left behind. All the left behind they are commemorating were killed in a variety of ways (wolves, an avalanche, bees), but the implication of the final scene with the Brandyfoots and their sheer panic at suffering a leg injury seems to suggest pretty strongly that any injury that prevents one from walking results in exile and, eventually, death - like the unfortunate Harfoot who got stuck in snow and was abandoned. The title of the episode, Adar, refers to the name the Orcs give the mysterious bad guy Arondir is taken to right at the end. Seeing Elves enslaved is a new direction for the series, as we are used to seeing them appear powerful, ethereal, in command of all they survey. Seeing them suffer like this definitely brings them down to (Middle-)earth a bit and makes them more relatable, though we are reminded they are Elves when they pull some rather cool-looking moves using their own chains as weapons against their captors. If Orcs are corrupted Elves, then presumably what we are seeing is that process in action.",goshamorrell,10,0.0,No,Adar,0,1

Its a TV series, not a movie!! ..an introduction is all needed in the 1st episode... the rhythm wasnt slow IMO considering this show with all the budget spent will last for 5 years at least ..there will be room for more to tell.I was very concerned when I saw the trailer 2 months ago... I didnt want it to be another  The wheel of time ...thankfully I can feel the spirit of LOTR in it.. and Im very optimistic.. episode 1 was very satisfying..it took me there!",basemajd-32933,10,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,4,8
Keeps getting interesting,"What i feared going into the first episode was put at ease with the second. I feared that we as the audiance would not be able to care or connect with the characters. But as this episode proved for nori(personally) and Durin, im hopeful. This episode was visually stunning, the dialogues good and the score as beautiful as the first episode. My only fear is to see where the show is going. I feel like something is missing but u cannot tell what exactly. I feel as if we dont spend enough time with the characters, but there is room for improvement in the next episodes. Im excited for more. Only complaint is the pacing (kinda), and id say i prefer the first episode still. Anyways, go in and watch the show with an open mind, youll not be disapointed.",ghennems,10,0.3333333333333333,No,Adrift,6,18
just the beginning!! way to go!!,"Watch the epic without LOTR in the mind! Beginning of another epic tale.Welcome to the world of Elves, Harfoots, Orcs and Dwarfs.Was not bad at all a little slow to get going but so many characters to introduce so is to be expected. However was pleasantly good 2 hours to start off with. Good acting from everyone in the cast.This version of Middle-earth is very well crafted. It is beautiful but feels very dangerous. There is so much more to explore in this World, and the show runners have crafted an excellent start for us to begin this journey.I do not know why all the lore so just as a series I think I will enjoy it very much. Looking forward to the rest of the season and hope it only gets better.

Lets goooo!!,"So epic, so early on, I dont know what you couldve ask more! True LOTR on steroids in terms of visuals and detailing plus a huge wtf moment at the end leaving us craving for more. At some point it felt like a finale since I really do expect and am perfectly fine with slow building up to epicness because of the 6 season initial plan but oh boy was that an awesome movie grade episode!! Characters are really starting to feel solid and well developed, i am excited for their stories and sequences, the mystery is revealing at a good pace and does not leave the feel you are baited in every next episode (like many modern series..).

Amazing episode this is truly what the series need,"Incredible episode full of action and meaningful scenes, just the right episode for this series and what was lacking till now. I had feeling that this first season is goings to be all build ups, as I jnew the full story from the books and such are super long and could be stretched across many seasons. Now this was a cery good indicator that we can have great episodes such as this l, at the same time that they trybto build up the story along side it. Right amount of action dialogue and epic cinematography and effects showed thta there is a good balance in this series. Hopefully we can more of the build ups but similar to this with great scenes in between that will be perfect for the rest of the season.",daniarjkawa,10,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,6,18
Masterful!,"This episode was a powerful reminder that Rings of Power meant business when it came to adapting Tolkiens work. Despite the many non-canonical characters and minor plot-modifications, Udûn was packed with enough potential to boost this series to the top of fan-approved lists.Director Charlotte Brändström did exceptional work in this episode. Writers Nicholas Adams, Justin Doble, J. D. Payne, and Patrick McKay did great scripting for it. Cinematography, costume, hair-makeup, and production design all performed praiseworthy work. Musical scoring, VFX, and editing were top-notch.The Helms Deep style battle weve all been anticipating took place this episode as Adar and his orcs marched on the watchtower of Ostirith. My previous reviews contain related details on this, so I shall keep from repeating them in this one. Joseph Mawle played Adar (a non-canonical character), did great work in this epi.I surmised that Adar was not a shape-shifted Sauron, a point that was proven in Rings of Power episode 6. He was, in actuality, an Elf twisted by Morgoths experimentations to become one of the first orcs or Uruk. The open use of the word called to mind Sarumans Uruk-hai, who featured in Peter Jacksons LOTR trilogy. Also, the very title of this episode referred to the new name that would later be given to the orc-conquered regions of the Southlands in Mordor.Delicious battle sequences and counter offensives played out this episode. They are sure to keep fans on the edge of their seats, and feeling nostalgia for Jacksons movies. Saurons broken enslavement-sword played a key (pun intended) role this epi.There was also a nice Arondir-centric throwback to when Gimli shattered his axe on the One Ring, not to forget that Adar-made reference to Galadriel using the One Ring, a sequence we see almost play out in Jacksons movies between her and Frodo.Ismael Cruz Cordova continued to impress as Arondir (non-canonical character). On a related note, Bronwyn (non-canonical character), played by Nazanin Boniadi, gave a stirring performance. And so did Theo (non-canonical character), played by Tyroe Muhafidin. This epi captured some distinct Frodo-and-the-Ring attachment vibes from Theo, namely for the broken Southlander-enslavement sword once made by Sauron.Another nice throwback took the form of dam waters being released, in this epi by Waldreg, and in Jacksons adaptation by the Ents. The way Elendil calmed a horse provided yet another throwback to a similar technique used by Aragorn in the Jackson movies.Plenty of further character-building took place in episode 6 Rings of Power, particularly around Halbrand (non-canonical character, played by Charlie Vickers) and Adar, whose empathy for his own was as surprising as his cruelty to all others. When the Númenorean forces finally joined the fray, it was all I could do not to leap out of my chair and scream for joy.Some great stunts and shots unravelled, especially around Galadriel, played by the inimitable Morfydd Clark. She was one of the episodes main highlights, both as a character and a performer. Also, the way Halbrand brought down Adars horse without harming the animal hinted at a special je ne sais quoi, which we may learn the (skilled technique) origins of in a future episode. In this one, he reluctantly reclaimed his role as the true king of the Southlands.This was also Isildurs (played by Maxim Baldry) first-ever battle, canonically speaking, and was interesting for several reasons not the least among them being that he would, many decades later, fight Sauron himself in the War of the Last Alliance. That was when he would perform the iconic picked up his fathers sword move and cut off the finger that held the One Ring, thus heralding the end of the Dark Lord and the war fought by the joint alliance of men and elves.Profound foreshadowing (of sorts) in this epi when he joined his father in the fight to safeguard the village and aided him at a crucial moment. In this case, he picked his father up and rejoined the fight. Both Maxim Baldry and his father Elendil, played by Lloyd Owen, gave good performances. They were also probably (in my opinion) fighting in the same spot or zone in which they would engage Sauron many decades later.The scenes where Adar tried to outride Galadriel, and obviously lost, were captivating. Galadriels elven-magic empowerment of her horse brought back memories of Arwen during the Nazgul chase (Jacksons adaptation). As for Halbrands full-circle moment, his conversation with Adar opened a world of possibilities. Adars interrogation by Galadriel soon proved to be an essential milestone in the Rings of Power series.This epi gave fans the first real battle to follow Jacksons much grander ones in the LOTR trilogy. It set a powerful standard, especially considering that this was the Second Age, an era that preceded Jacksons (and Tolkiens of course) Lord of the Rings timeline by millennia. Talk about history repeating.Note: The broken sword featured in the show was not the same as the one Isildur used in the Last Alliance War. What Waldreg (non-canonical character), played by Geoff Morrell, did with it near the end portended great doom. Uruk Adars grand scheme also came to light, enough to whet our appetites for the grand entry of Sauron in future episodes. Adar was desperate to get his hands on the broken enslavement sword, to what end we learned near the conclusion of this epi - dang you, Waldreg. The orcs were building all those tunnels for a reason indeed.This episode let us witness the creation of Mount Doom (!!!). The region around it was soon shrouded in volcanic ash and fire. A portion of it will later come to be called Udûn, which would someday boast the Black Gate (!!!). That final second of the epi with Galadriel froze me to my seat.Classic Tolkien vibes, Peter Jackson nostalgia bursts, battle craze, and plot twists fueled the success of this episode in meaningful ways. Youll not have seen anything like it in streaming. Amazon Studios has yet again pushed the limits of whats possible for a television show. This epi will leave you with goosebumps more than a few times. Rings of Power: Udûn episode 6 was a visual and auditory feast for Tolkien-fan-senses. It has me drooling for what theyre going to serve up next week.",BijeshNagesh,10,0.2962962962962963,Yes,Udûn,8,27

I hope everyone will not judge the series from the beginning and give it a chance.War, destruction, and photography are creativity in the truest sense of the word, but the direction is very imaginary.

Amazing episode!!!,"This episode was awesome. I enjoyed every moment of it and the acting of the actors. From Arundyrs fight with the orcs and the moment when the orcs dagger is close to his eye, When Bernwyn was one step away from death and was forced to turn the sword to Adar , Galadriels extraordinary dodge and the spectacular blow that the orc gave him (this Galadriel is likable), the chase of Galadriel and Adar, and the surprising presence of Halbrand , and at the end The one where Galadriel stood firm in front of the fire coming towards him, which makes me impatiently wait for episode 7.

Amazing,"This episode is quite amazing in terms of art, drama and plot. I havent touched that much since the matrix movie, the begging of this season was calm a bit and help us to live with characters, which made me reach an amazing touch with the story in this episode, we can see the way everyone choose to protect the precious things in his live, and that live is not fair for every one, after watching this greatness, I cant rate less than 10/10, The events move the feelings to a great extent, also there are no pornographic scenes in the events and doing a work free of pornography to this extent is art in itself.",solimanahmed-59065,10,0.3,No,Udûn,6,20

I for one loved the way the battle ebbs and flows and reaches a shocking conclusion.The highlight of the episode was Galadriel and Adars meeting. Their dialogues were so well written and set the stage perfectly. Adar is such a likeable, perfect villain.The end of the episode would leave you jaw-dropped. It sets up the rest of the season perfectly.Also, boy was this episode a slap in the face of the haters.

"Best episode by far, expecting more","I have been a critic of Rings of Power until now, but after all the wait, this episode is still the best until now. The battle we waited for, the struggle, and finally some more plot. Honestly this episode had lots of twists and turns. It keeps us on the edge until the very end. Revealing bits and pieces of the story. And did not expect the episode to end that way. Cant wait for the next one now.There were few parts which could be improved, as the plot was going so intense, we had to do a surgery in the middle of the battle, which felt like it could have been reduced more and we could have more focused on the way peoples mind changed from hope to tragedy to again hope. But still, this was the only scene which slowed the pace in this fast moving episode.",deepak-32317,10,0.2857142857142857,Yes,Udûn,6,21
"It was fine until now, now its a definite keeper","I loved how beautiful it all was.

I am blown away and wille watch it again, in fact i have already replayed parts of it to see the sheer views and effects. Proud to be Swedish at this time as a Swede directed this episode! I dont mind the pacing even in the end, i would say it gives a contrast the LOTR definitely need and to be fair, Tolkien never was much for fights.

Amazing episode,"After a lot of build up we were finally presented with a fast paced episode, exquisite battle scene and an interesting dive on the origins and aspirations of the orcs.Galadriel depiction is starting to make sense. From just angry with no understandable reason why, to someone which is the result of numerous battles and resulting grief. What we watched in this episode is what she experienced countless times, being unable to disconnect from the fight against what see perceives as a prevalent and growing evil.If the other story arcs follow up as good as this one the show will be an utter triumph.

This episode finally gave me a reason to be excited about what they are doing. I also think this episode gave the previous episodes more purpose since we can finally see where its going. I loved the action, the scenery, the music, all of it. It really occurred to me when watching tonight that they have put a TON of money into this project as it looks incredible.

Weve been waiting for this!,"A very good episode overall, but an excellent ending.We should all know that a TV show is different from a movie in terms of plotting, and thats why we could be bored at some points while watching an episode. A movie can be very dense when it comes to epic scenes, touching moments, revealing facts, and creating events, while a series lacks these elements, and thats fine.I got a little bit bored while watching this episode, especially in the beginning, BUT it was worth it as the last 4 minutes were shockingly entertaining.I believe this is the beginning to watch something heavy and epic as we long desired.",Beeto97,10,0.25,No,Udûn,7,28
A story that builds is a story that thrills.,"A fantastic pay off for a series that at times seemed very slow paced and repetitive. We have finally left Numenor after three episodes of intense stagnation and tedious exposition that lead nowhere.But, that aside, this episode delivered. Beautiful cinematography, well acted, gorgeous landscapes and higher stakes.The threads seem to be coming together, the question is, was the dallying about at the beginning of series necessary? And, will it hurt the future of the series.This episode is a 10/10, the three preceding episodes 5/10 with an overall score for 7 for the series so far. This reviewer would say watch, but be prepared to for the torturous 3 episodes in Numenor, stick with it... and it will become interesting.",edward-27911,10,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,3,9

So have patience young generation, good shows build up slowly, characters develop, mood is set, then you have a good show. It cant all just be about fighting and grunting, a story needs to unfold.Pay no attention to comments from viewers or to bad ratings by people who just want to see sword fights and battle horns. This is the fantasy genre, and it is best shown and told the way we see it in this show.

Classic epic action which fill gaps in Middle earths history,"Yes, where do you start? First, now its happening. The episode focuses on the Southerners desperate defense against an overpowering horde of orcs, led by the mysterious Adar (Father). Meanwhile, Numenors small army is on the way, and only days away. Will they make it? The battles between humans and orcs have taken some inspiration from classics like Kurosawas Seven Samurai. Its a nice mix of popular uprising, bloody martial arts, and ultimately total doom. The actors do a very solid job. In a single scene, they touch on the tear-filled sloppiness that almost made LOTR 3 unbearable at times, but stay on the right side of the line. The characters are straightforward, believable and sometimes impressive. Some scenes are very brutal in their rawness where people are killed ruthlessly just because you can. Children should probably watch this with adults to then be able to reason about the content. A small question mark for me is if or when there will be truly epic battles in this series. The battles in this episode are powerful, but not grand in scope. I liked Galadriel from the first episode. Here she stands out as a superhumanly skilled warrior in a good way. It is simply a joy to watch her fight. The end of the episode is massive and sets the stage for the big bads entrance. Im already worried about the season ending soon.Are there any weaknesses in the episode? It probably depends on who you are, and expectations. As for the plot at large, there are what I know of parts not mentioned in Tolkiens texts. At the same time, it fills in gaps in Tolkiens description. In The Silmarillion, Pharazon attacks Sauron and takes him prisoner when he becomes a threat. This happens before. That it is before would also explain the small scale of Numenors intervention. Then, of course, there are many small and large differences compared to the books. The main features are correct, but the differences are probably enough to make those who believe in the letter twitch their beards. However, those who love Tolkiens world and know the whole thing will have no more problems with this than Nick Perumovs books. Another consideration one might have is that many of the characters are a bit deeper and less black and white than how Tolkien portrays them. It is a necessary grip when going from mythological prose to film. Apart from some liberties in the interpretation of the gaps in Tolkiens texts, this is on par with or better than the best made-for-film fantasy, in a TV episode. Other than that: Picture, sound, music, acting and environments are fantastic. As I write this, Ive watched the episode twice in two days. If no one stops me I will watch it twice more before the next episode. Name a movie you want to see four times in a week, thats not many.",ludvig-37371,10,0.22727272727272727,No,Udûn,5,22
Each episodes supersedes the following one in sheer spectacle,"How anyone can say theres no story or its boring is beyond mind boggling. This is easily the best show on tv now and so far above HOD in every way imaginable. While that show flounders in the continuing, tedious storyline of who will be heir or claim their birthright; this show forges on with its grand World encompassing story of Saurons oncoming threat. No matter what anyone says there is only speculation as to Meteor Mans identity and who Sauron is. This episode featured wall to wall action, fantastic stunt work, great battles and many suspenseful moments. Arondir is easily our favorite character among many good ones.

I hope this episode will shut those who hate on the show and compare it to House of dragon, which is also great, but this was another level of epic!First few episodes were a bit more slow which may be less exciting, but they led us deeper into the storyline just the right way.

Arondir is like legolas,a badass with a bow and off bow too. Galadriels stunt works are awesome. Halbrand story is still a mystery. My guess is that Halbrand might be Sauron after all 😅😁. Adar whose character I thought was not up to the mark has excelled this episode with his brilliant plan. He built a place of darkness (Mordor) for the orcs to live. Dont know why Bronwyn is alive they should have killed her. Cant wait to see whats coming next and how they wrap this season.",bunny-78998,10,0.2,Yes,Udûn,1,5
Every middle earth fan will love this,"So Rings of Power returns this week with an episode big on action... but low on logic. I know a lot of people are going to enjoy this chapter, and to be fair there are some visually stunning scenes in here. The final 5 minutes, with that big volcanic pyroclastic cloud closing in on the villagers, was absolutely spectacular and worth the $50 million budget this week. But then we come to the writing and everything falls apart. At the start of the episode, Elendil told Miriel on the ship that making landfall would take a full days sail into the mountains, and from there another days ride east into the vale. So 2 days after the opening scene of Arondir destroying an entire tower with one rope and besting the little legion of orcs. But then Galadriel and the others arrive the next night, with no word on exactly how they mustered up all those horses, got everyone onto land and began riding across the vale. And no word on exactly how long it would take to get there once they started riding. Its poor writing on the level of Game of Thrones season 8, with teleporting armies and logistics that dont add up. Youre telling me all those soldiers and horses, not to mention full lots of armour were on three boats? Even Troy, back in 2004, managed to get the logistics right with the sheer number of ships going into battle and that film has a litany of problems. But then we come to other parts of this episode too. Arondir taking everyone out the well fortified guard tower to go and fight in a wooden tavern in a village where he can easily be stopped is just... idiotic? I mean, in Two Towers Edoras was up on a hill and Theoden and the others realized it wasnt a defendable position against the orcs and left. Here though, theres no tactics or thought put into this at all. Speaking of The Two Towers, the number of repurposed scenes from that movie is insane. From Bootleg Helms Deep, complete with torches on the horizon, to these Eastlands being similar to Rohan in that villagers are tasked with fighting, all the way over to the little shots of the taverns interior, everything here is designed to be a call-back to The Two Towers; I half expected some Ents to show up and save the day. On a more positive note though, Adars character is easily one of the best in this show and the idea of adding orc morality into the fold is a fascinating one. At the same time, it also makes Galadrel look even more evil than she already is and its amusing to think she almost killed Adar herself after telling Halbrand that he cant do it as it wont satisfy his revenge. But I guess Halbrand is king because he said so?",goshamorrell,10,0.0,No,Udûn,0,1
A truely awesome and inspiring episode,"So,Personally I have liked The Rings of Power so far, albeit none of the previous episodes were action packed or awe inspiring.Episode 6 is different. Loads of battles. Some really vicious, cruel and scary deaths. Orcs are best as horror. Its all edge of your seat stuff until the very last minute, with an ending you dont see coming until, well, the end!The investment in watching the first five episodes has finally paid off.For me, I read the Silmarillion, and the Rings of Power is taking liberties with the chronological order of the dates in it. But, dont let that worry you. J. R. R. Tolkein never published it himself and was constantly revising the historical dates. Just view and watch the epsiode for what it is. A fan insprired made for telly adaptation, which still uses the main characters from the Silmarillion, but adds loads more new ones to keep you guessing what will happen next.",chasteis,10,0.3333333333333333,No,Udûn,6,18

When Adar first does it, it seemed like dark magic meant to spawn more orcs or maybe even protect his soul phylactery style should he fall in battle. But its just part of his past that he clings to, driving home why he decided to give up on Sauron. Adar was understandably tired of being a lieutenant to a distracted boss who views the orcs as disposable cannon fodder at best and has more recently been using them as experimental subjects for his research.",thsandesh,10,0.35294117647058826,No,Udûn,6,17

Galadriels acting was literally amazing and the mystery according to who sauron really is, is also really amazing. In my opinion I think for the first time they proved all the haters wrong. The orcs were also really good made. They were better than any previous lord of the rings movie. Isildur and the prisoned elves were also amazing.

I cant wait to see what more comes from this exciting new fantasy series!They did a great job filming and integrating various species and backstories to set the stage for this, and I am sure it will be a fan favorite in no time.The explanation for the elves position in having to begin fighting and their lack of a word for death was especially notable from the start. It gave a healthy understanding of why they feel so reluctant to trust any other groups. As an avid lover of fantasy I feel that seeing all the places such as Lindon, the Capitol of the Elves really helps to fully visualize Galadriels experience and her suffering alike.",al-51074,10,0.5555555555555556,No,A Shadow of the Past,5,9

Cant wait to see the villain and Id love to see Annatar the Lord of Gifts, hopefully they have rights to use this name for Sauron.I was pleasantly surprised with original characters honestly, Dwarven atmosphere felt like home and it was magnificent, Harfoots took seconds for me to fall in love with them.Well deserved 10/10 from me!",guzguzina,10,0.4666666666666667,Yes,A Shadow of the Past,7,15

The only reason I made this because of the monkeys out there, attacking the show in unjustified reason and giving it a rating of 3/10 or even 1/10 while garbage shows get 8Watching the first episode reminded me of the first time I saw Fellowship of the Ring it hooked me in, and the two hours episode just flew in minutes.The story/pacing and acting all fantasticAll the hate from what Ive seen is its big budget. And ofc some game of thrones fans.Like budget wise, it got the same budget as games of thrones,and some people are saying that the dialog and acting are mediocre at best. Excuse have you even seen the show!So Stop attacking the show just because your a crazy nut for games of thrones.Enjoy the two showsboth house of dragon and rings of powers are great so far. I still dont have a favorite of the two since its still on second episode.",hamadkoy,10,0.5,No,A Shadow of the Past,5,10
Best episode so far,"Amazing episode. Yes there are still a lot of conveniences and characters are protected with plot armor, but this episode was just thrilling from start to finish with the ending image quite a sight to see. Some serious tension throughout but also still found so much time for levity with the villagers. Adar has been so cliched so far but this episode gave him some fascinating development. The real star though was the directing from Charlotte Brandstrom. Really felt like out of all the directors so far, she replicates Peter Jackson style in the best ways: the sweeping shots of the armies and horse riding, the almost slasher body horror of war, but also real moments of emotion. I kinda squealed when Isildur got that side hug from daddy. This is fun TV!",sergeifranson,10,0.5,No,Udûn,148,296
"Wow, wonderful episode!!","Wow. Seventy minutes of exciting action, beautiful and moving moments. This episode made all of us, almost shout at the tv worrying about our favourite characters. Arondir is just so terrific and Bronwyn and Galadriel are too as is Halbrand. The exciting battles were reminiscent of true LoTR Helms Deep. You just had to see what would happen next!! All the people who have criticised the colour and gender mix of this series are missing so much, Numenor and the boats were just too glorious to behold, tonights episode built on character development and shows so much promise for whats coming next.

The plot takes an unexpected but very welcome turn,"From Episode 5, we were expecting the big battle between Orcs and the humans of the Southlands. Which happens, but with several surprises.What really astonishes is what Adar later explains. His relationship with Sauron, which is not what was expected.From Episode 5, I had thought of an extra. Tolkiens own notes, written up for The Silmarillion, suggest that Sauron tried to repent. So he could both be The Stranger and genuinely trying to help. I wrote a blog on this: The Rings of Power: Not All Who Wonder Or Wander Are Lost.What comes out now is nothing I expected, but supporting this view. Watch it and be amazed!We now see why the start was slow. What is unfolding is different from what Tolkien wrote. But very consistent with his repeated point that it is easy to become evil by using the wrong methods with a real intent to do good.",GwydionMW,10,0.4453125,No,Udûn,171,384
Epic story,"Adar has been the standout performer of all the characters, which was let down by galadriel. Also, arondirs acting is also worthy noting. This episode provides immense action scenes, and often take you to the battlefield of Lord of the rings, but this episod has successfully passed in creating a legacy of its own. The Tolkien fans may be disappointed and say they spoiled Tolkiens works, but it is better to have a new perspective and backstory of middle Earth. The final twist was magnificent, as we now know how southlands eternally became mordor and sunlight never touches there.Also the biggest waiting is continued for next week as well, because the main villain entry has not yet happened. Also there are many susceptible culprits who might turn out as sauron including the stranger, halbrand, Theo, pharazon, annatar etc.Cant wait for next episode.",brawlmedia,10,0.4479495268138801,Yes,Udûn,142,317

Delightful Visuals + Enchanting Dialogue,"Visually stunning - no one can deny that. But since we are spoiled so much by amazing cgi these days, I invite you to focus instead on the wardrobe of the characters, especially their armor. The Elven soldier from the watchtower(?) - who is without a doubt a serious badass just by how smoothly he swings his bow around his shoulder as if hes done it for 79 years - has such an awesome breastplate! The palma merenti crown that elves wear looks sooo fancy, too.When the elves talk, it feels like we are watching a play; Elrond and Galadriels dialogue sounds Shakespearean with flowery prose that matches the gorgeous garden setting. Words fall out of their elven mouths like ethe golden leaves that grace their capes.I enjoy that this is a series, and not a movie. I feel like with the series we can take our time developing more of the story, the characters, and dive deeper into the land of Middle Earth.

It is the first episode of the rings of power, that I really felt like watching the original lord of the rings. We finally so a battle in the series. It felt like the coming of elves to the aid of aragorn in the lord of the rings. The music also leveled up. In the previous episodes, the score used to feel like spiderman or game of thrones. But here, I really felt my presence in the middle-earth. And the plor twist at the end. I really thought Arondir gave the axe to Theo to teach a lesson. But it was the opposite indeed.

Best episode,Best episode thus far. Dont listen to critics. If you watch from the beginning you will enjoy the story now. This episode will keep you engaged. Fight scenes are amazing. Visuals are stunning. Best moment for me is at the end of this episode. Orcs have done a great job. Fights are not as grand as Lord of the rings but we are only in 6th episode and we have several more to come. The best thing I like about this series there is no profanity or nudity unlike House of the dragon series. You van enjoy this show with your family and children definitely.

Not quite the intensity of the Two Towers, but felt like very familiar territory. Some may say lazy writing, but I loved the to and fro with the traps, ending with Waldregs moment (without spoiling) (I did have to whizz back to see when the change over happened) The battle scenes were done well enough to keep it safe for a 12/14 audience (helps having kids of that age!) &amp; hopefully satisfy the more bloodthirsty viewer.

Arondir in particular stood out in this episode and you cant help but love his character more and more. Seeing the Numernorians ride through the Southlands really threw me back into the LOTR I know and love, we saw more depth between Isildur and Elendils characters and Adar couldnt have been better written. The ambiguity surrounding Halbrands character and his past grows more with each episode and Galadriel seems back in her natural environment on the battlefield rather than the Numenorians courts...

There are fans, there are purists, and then there are the religious nuts, the ones who treat the Tolkien world as you would a religions bible. These critical-spirited trolls are trying to ruin a show for the rest of us that just want new bits of a beloved world. LOTR is entertainment, not a religion that is thousands of years old.

There is actually a solid fundament starting to form.At this moment, the show can make or break. But for the last 2 episodes, it is surely more make than break.Much can be said about what the serie brings, we all know series like Troy, falling into a black hole of racial preference and judgemental pre-definitions of viewers.

The stakes of the series rose faster than viewers could contemplate and the episode ended with a huge WTF moment and a cliffhanger ending. First things first, however, let us talk about that glorious battle we were all waiting for! Since the last 2-3 episodes this battle was being built up, and it wont be too far fetched, should I say that it exceeded all expectations. It was full of twists and turns, and blood and gore, basically all you need from a fantasy battle. Spears were shaken, shields were splintered, a sword day, a red day, and a mount exploded!

Actually a good episode,"I lot of fanbois rate this a 1/10 for reasons its not the original due to their extreme attachment to the original trilogy. The trilogy is, indeed, one of the best of all time in fantasy, if not in any genre. But alas, this Prime Video prequel is not meant to be anything like its inspiration. Its a show, and it does exactly what most of us would expect: entertain.That nonsense out of the way, this episode was a 10/10 in terms of entertainment and captivation. The season as a whole had some boring and SLOW, pacing issues, but this episode had stakes and payoff. I can only hope season 2 will actually have some real story-telling and less establishing characters bullshit. They could have made stuff a lot more interesting.It was a great story. The season as a whole, meh, 7/10 is generous, but the music and effects made up for the dull storytelling at times, along with a few interesting sequences, and my prior love for LOTR in general. Good finale, it made up for a lot of stuff I was previously not thrilled about.I believe most of you will enjoy it, and it will rekindle your hope for the second season! :)",tenfolds,10,0.4457831325301205,No,Alloyed,37,83
I\m Good!,"This story likes to dance around things that might reveal who a character is and what their motivations are, but it stops short of revealing exactly who that character is.For example: there were three strange looking women that appeared, they were very interested in the crater left by the Stranger, and the Stranger himself.Ultimately, their goals and intentions were revealed, and were not good. But just like us, they were fooled. In this case they had fooled themselves, and they fell into their own trap. And in doing so they gave us a few more clues to the identity of the Stranger. We now know that if the Stranger was not who they believed he was, then in fact he was somebody, something else. Somebody who we hope that he is.That seems to be the theme here, not just the theme of the show but its also embedded in Tolkeins books and stories and appendices. Misdirection.We have to remember that Sauron fooled ELVES, as wise and intelligent as they are, they fell for it. But mainly Galadriel fell for it. And when she fell for it, so too, us.She was basically fed what she wanted to hear and that caused her to set upon a course of action that will affect the very landscape of not just middle earth but Numenor and all other lands from the stories.A lot of people, when talking about this show, are distraught because they feel that Tolkien is being rewritten.This is not so. This is exactly what he wanted, although it never happened in his own time, it is happening now. He wanted other people to expand upon what he had already written. So his works, starting with the Silmarillion, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Rings appendices, and his several books of Lost Tales... They are a tapestry which gives us something to start with and to build upon.As long as we dont stray too far from the themes and characters that have already been developed. And this show does a very good job of keeping to the stories that have already been written.We forget that Tolkien wanted to write these stories because he felt that Britain had no mythology of its own. Thanks to Tolkien, now they do.So the framework we are given here that started with The Hobbit and then Lord of the Rings, can be viewed as this new mythology.Those of us who are familiar with the history of events from middle earth, can now see those events in much more detail. There were Catastrophes and Eucatastrophes all through the history of middle earth, bad things that happened and good things that happened.And this season stops with one of the good things that happened, a eucatastrophe, even though it was surrounded by catastrophes.In fact all through this episode some very horrible things have happened to most of the groups that are shown, but with each of those groups of people, the Elves in their city, The Harefoots as they travel with The Stranger, The Numinorians... something good develops from each of those catastrophes.We are going to have to wait to check in with the fate of Durins Folk and the Southrons.",XweAponX,10,0.39037433155080214,No,Alloyed,73,187
The finale brings it all home,"My primary complaint throughout the season had been that the show moved too slow across too many characters while raising more questions than answers. That said, the finale did a fantastic job of bringing the storylines together and finally answering some of the questions weve all been begging to learn.Across the storylines, this episode presents us with strong feelings of hope, anger, resolution, and sorrow.

From great camera work, to a smooth pacing that feels absolutely spot on, the way the strands of the story come together feels right and impressive by any standard.

Could have been better season,This episode is overall fine. I gave 10 stars to compensate for all the negative reviews. Galadriel is good to watch and overall done a good job. Other eleves are excellent. Numanoreans have a nice place but nothing else to boast. Dwarves are disappointing to watch and just too much talk with no action. Harfoots are not hilarious and just wasted several hours in this season. Southlanders are sad in most of the season and did well here and there.

It took me to the final episode to make that decision but I think I like where this is going. It was a bit of a slow start to this season but to me that fits very well with Tolkiens writing style, and with this finale it showed that the writers understand the story they are telling even if it doesnt follow the source material almost at all lol, its all there in feeling and Im honestly looking forward to the rest!",jagejonna,10,0.24242424242424243,No,Alloyed,8,33
Good or Evil - that is the question,"I didnt read all of the books and know almost nothing about the Second Age, but I wouldnt mind if there are differences between the books and the show. In the books there are a lot of powerful male characters. In the show I like to have also strong female main characters to drive the story in this epic fantasy adventure.Rings of Power is an amazing show from beginning to end. I loved the story arc and all the elements about good and evil. Sometimes it is not obvious to the viewer and not even to the characters themselves to distuinguish between good and evil. The evil can touch the light and the good can touch the darkness - this thematic flows through the whole show. When the good has strong revenge feelings and is about to slay the enemy (even if imprisoned) and the evil is able to feel compassion and empathy and seems to be able to love, then it is clear that the characters are grey shaded (I am convinced that the villain was not telling lies). Even evil is convinced to be acting good.I loved the complexity and deepness of the characters (especially Galadriel, Halbrand and Adar).The exciting story and character development is supported by overwhelming music, amazing scenery and brilliant costume designs. I had a big wow moment when I saw Númenor.There are so many details in the show. So I want to see it many times more.

What a Great Story but !! Keep reading here,"Awesome, but less than expected, in the episode, from my point of view, the reason for the bad evaluations away from the hatred of the series just because of the hate and the repetition of words used without meaning. Every person was imagining an announced scenario for the story and wants the character he loves to appear because if it does not appear, this blinds him that he will never see it on screen and so you understand what I mean? When they recounted events contrary to the imaginations of everyone, they became angry and did not accept the idea, although it was very acceptable and enjoyable.. The dialogues need more depth.. Galadriel after the last episode became more realistic, but frankly, it is not the best performance ever, especially as it is a front for the series.. It is possible to correct the path in the next season. Without introducing other goals, exaggerating some people. If this is done, it will be a great work..

although the series leaves us wanting more.And since times immemorial, we all know this, ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY WALK INTO MORDOR, and one does not simply make a good series based out of middle earth, the way sir peter jackson did..plus times have changed, and this is not early 2000s and most of us have grown up, so we can never love any content as much as we loved LOTR..",dnrax,10,0.3235294117647059,No,Alloyed,11,34
Sauron Revealed,"Id been guessing that The Stranger was Sauron, and that Sauron had genuinely repented and was trying to do good. I blogged on this, The Rings of Power: Not All Who Wonder Or Wander Are Lost.It all seemed vindicated, but then everything turns. First, we see Halbrand giving vital clues to Celebrimbor about a process of tapping power. And he meantime uses exactly the same words that Adar reported Sauron as using.She confronts and confirms, and meantime The Stranger turned out to be some other powerful being, and banishes Saurons servants. But not forever, Im sure.Incidentally, they should not call him Sauron. In the book, they never do because the name is an insult.We get the Three Elven Rings made before the 16 that will go to Elves and Dwarves. Since these are credited to Celebrimbor, Id assume that Halbrand / Sauron manages to overcome Galadriels denunciation, which she cannot explain.And I was right about Sauron genuinely trying to be good. He saved Galadriel because he was partly free of Morgoths influence, and wants her beside him as his Queen, and being good rulers. But does not see that his own power might be a bad thing.And it ends with Nori and The Stranger heading for Rhun.

Here comes season 2!!!,"The show has finally cleared up the issue of who Halbrand and the Stranger actually are, thank goodness. And we will hold our hands up and say, we admit it, we were wrong! Halbrand is Sauron after all, as half the internet had guessed a few episodes ago. The reveal was nicely done, balancing the growing realization for fans of Tolkien with a dramatic and, more importantly, clear and unambiguous reveal for non-book readers. When Halbrand started offering Celebrimbor advice on how to make artifacts of power, and called it a gift, Tolkien fans knew for sure who he was. In Tolkiens lore, Sauron appeared to Celebrimbor in the form of Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, and convinced him to work together to make the first 16 Rings of Power (the Dwarves Seven rings and mortals Nine). For those unfamiliar with the text, the reveal followed shortly afterwards. Galadriel and Halbrand/Saurons confrontation was tense, powerful, emotionally loaded, and beautifully visualized. The use of visions enhanced and emphasized the verbal power struggle between them, presenting Sauron as a Devil-like character, showing our hero visions to try to tempt her away from the path of good. Will Fletcher playing Sauron-as-Finrod deserves recognition as well, for a gloriously creepy performance that sent chills down the spine. Now Sauron has gone off to make the One Ring, and we havent heard or seen anything about the Seven for the Dwarf-lords or the Nine for Mortal Men. Durin and Disa werent even in this episode. For non-book readers, this presents a minor plot hole, since the Rhyme of the Rings clearly refers to them; for film fans, we know that the Nine at least are very important. For book fans, its a huge, gaping hole in the plot. Presumably Sauron will go and forge those 16 rings in season 2, or Celebrimbor will. Its certainly a resolvable issue, but leaving it unresolved across the gap between seasons is a bit perplexing. A bit of a guessing game can be fun, and disguise and trickery were certainly elements of Saurons character and methods in Tolkiens lore, so the idea of holding off on revealing Halbrands or the Strangers identity in itself isnt bad. But it was dragged out for so long, and there was so much guessing and uncertainty and rather unnecessary layers of mystery over this season that viewers were left not entirely sure what story they were actually watching. Now we know, and we can get properly invested in the characters we are supposed to be invested in. We need to feel we have the same knowledge of who Gil-galad and Pharazôn really are.",goshamorrell,10,0.0,No,Alloyed,0,2

An ambitious reminder of the wonder of Tolkiens world,"I think many of us have forgotten the sheer glory it was to see LOTR back when it first came out.The multitude of life and the beauty and horror it contained.This series seems to remember and wants to remind us that the world of Middle Earth and beyond is a trove of stories. Both from the creator Tolkien and others who love his works.I love this show so far. Beautiful but filled with uncertainty.

Perfection,"The debut episode of Rings of Power conjures the magic that made Peter Jacksons original trilogy so special. It oozes that comforting warmth of Middle Earth and makes you genuinely fearful of the horrors that work in the shadows that seek to destroy it. The visuals are stunning; being the first ever TV show, in my opinion, to truly feel like a big-budget film. Being a kind-of prologue, the episode lays very good groundwork for the overall narrative and individual characters; whom will undoubtably cross paths down the line. Im a kid watching the first hour of Fellowship of the Ring again. I never expected, as an adult, to have this joy once again.",christianmsmith,10,0.5833333333333334,No,A Shadow of the Past,7,12
Best Novel adaptation show of the decade,"Episode 2 has more action than episode 1, with the sea serpent and Orc attack sequences kicking off the adventure part of the story, even while we are still getting to know this world through the Dwarves. The sea serpent attack is a great example of the sort of thing that, while the scene is invented for the series, feels like something that would happen in Tolkiens stories (and as different as the world of Narnia is, the fact that theres a well-known sea serpent passage in his friend C. S. Lewis books doesnt hurt!). It doesnt contradict anything, it makes sense within that world. The second episode follows on from the plot of the first, with each members of Middle-Earth uncovering that something ominous and dangerous is on the way, and dealing with it in their own specific way. Now, with such a large ensemble cast and epic scale, one may worry about the concept of characters being ignored. But if Episode 1 was focused on setting up the series lore, then Episode 2 is focused on its characters, and it feels better for it. Obviously exposition is necessary for the fantasy world of Middle-Earth. Granted, some characters are less iconic than others so far. The romantic relationship between a human and an elf (Nazanin Boniadi and Ismael Cruz Córdova respectively) lacks any form of chemistry. Their pairing is given some interest at least from the tension between humans and elves, a tension which carries into the original trilogy. Though, sometimes this tension feels like wasted potential. An ocean scene between an elf and a group of humans switches back and forth sporadically, and then theyre almost all killed off before anything can be explored. This show continues to create a perfectly tense atmosphere, following the rise to power that big bad Sauron makes, with more and more mysterious hints and dark imagery being shown. These hints are matched with an epically scary score - though this music can sometimes overstay its welcome. The setting of Middle-Earth continues to be a spectacle of its own, which is emphasized by clever use of both practical and CGI effects - which can also be seen in the opening credits. We may never get the exact feeling that we did while watching the fellowship roam the hills of New Zealand, but we can appreciate that The Rings of Power is definitely trying.",goshamorrell,10,0.0,No,Adrift,0,1

My only fear is to see where the show is going. I feel like something is missing but u cannot tell what exactly. I feel as if we dont spend enough time with the characters, but there is room for improvement in the next episodes. Im excited for more. Only complaint is the pacing (kinda), and id say i prefer the first episode still. Anyways, go in and watch the show with an open mind, youll not be disapointed. Let it the time it needs to breathe. Weve grown to be very impatient. For instance the first episodes of game of thrones were kinda slow paced, and most people connected with the characters only deeper in the season.

The pacing kind of threw me off initially but later got used to it. I think in the age where every episode requires nudity and gore to please the audience, this show has made the bold choice to put plot and character arcs over it. Its a nice change and a welcome one.Loved the mystery about strange man and halbrand.. Galadriels arc could have been a little better.

Wayne Che Wip = GENIUS!,"I teach media and film studies at a college in Oxfordshire, I have been using episodes of various TV shows directed by Wayne Yip for years as resources in lessons, especially his work on Misfits, Utopia and Preacher. I only just recently learned that he came to the college I teach at, finishing his degree in graphic design the summer before I began teaching.I genuinely think this guy is really special, and his work on this first series, which I have resoundingly felt were the best episodes, have proven me correct.The negative reviews of this series I believe come about because it suffers from the same problem that the first series of Game of Thrones did, it has so much and so many different places and people to set up. I remember when GoT first aired one of my fellow media lecturers moaning It is all just people whispering in dark corridors.However, with this final episode, Wayne Yip truly kicks the series into gear and shows us what we can expect in future series ( I believe he has been given a lot more creative control by being made showrunner).Finally this episode takes us to a place that feels like it could be a scene from Peter Jacksons excellent trilogy, rather than, as it sometimes did in certain scenes, feeling like something cut from the woeful last Hobbit film.Well done Mr Yip, local lad done well.",medwards-85263,10,0.3170731707317073,No,Alloyed,13,41

I think the score added so much to this series as a whole.

Great finale for a great season of a great show,"For a long time Tolkien fan I enjoyed this season very very much. The finale was the cherry on top of that great first part of that show. I was so sad to read that it may only return in 2024.For a someone who knows the lore of all of Tolkiens work there were no big surprises here, but I still loved all the revealing moments in that episode. They were just done so damn well. I had tears on my eyes, when Gandald realized who he really is and the way he talked about adventure and to follow your nose when in doubt. It was pure LOTR feeling. And when the first three rings were forged I had goose bumps. Maybe its the nostalgia and the fan serve, but it just works!Unfortunately haters gonna hate and Im so sad that the show gets downrated by so many people just because.

There were some good reveals which may have surprised people or not, such as who is Sauron. I am happy they didnt make him an elf called Annotar because that would have been way too obvious and people would have complained. Instead the person who played Sauron played their role very well and deceived many of us.The Harfoots and the stranger are finally finding some adventure.

Masterful Ending.,"Rings of Power has been pretty good for me, albeit a couple episodes of meandering and other issues. Overall though, Ive enjoyed it. I thought the penultimate episode, while decent, was a bit lacking. This massively coarse corrected and ended things in a epic and satisfying way.The Strangers storyline is finally, mostly resolved. We now know he is in fact one of the Istari, and like many suspected, he is most likely Gandalf. Although thats not the name he goes by, it is implied by serval clues and callbacks to some of Gandalfs lines from Lord of
the Rings. Hes definitely Gandalf. Do I care that hes not supposed to arrive this early? No. Its a television show. You have to do time compression, else wed have a show spanning a literal thousand years. Anyways, loved the Strangers story this episode, and excited to see where he and Nori go next season.The identity of Sauron has been debated the entire season. Suspects included: Halbrand, The Stranger, Bronwyn, and literally everyone we could think of. Sauron is in fact, Halbrand, of course! There were many subtle, and obvious clues to this being the case. Charlie Vickers was brilliant in this episode, switching from noble low-man to the Dark Lord himself was really satisfying to watch. He nailed the manipulative and seductive nature of Sauron perfectly.Another huge portion of this episode was devoted to the creation of the three elven Rings. This really wasnt something I expected to see yet, so I was thrilled seeing this happen in this episode.Overall, the finale couldnt be more thrilling and satisfying. It concluded the first chapter in this story, and left us wanting more.",alasdairboswell,10,0.36666666666666664,Yes,Alloyed,11,30

If there is a next season, the ending of this season was so good, and reached such a stunning climax that if another season does not come, then it will have been satisfying. It has told the story of the three rings. Saurons return to Mordor and the ending song point to the creation of the one ring. It has answered the central question, and pointed the way for all of the dependent storylines. I hope for more, but it really isnt necessary.

Im glad they didnt emphasize on the newly created characters, instead kept the focus on all the characters we already know and were eager to see more of.All the characters that we know from the movies had interesting arcs and in retrospect you could see how their movie portrayal makes sense and is in line with who they were thousands of years ago.The writers have crafted each line of dialog so well, almost each line deserves to be a quotable quote.Season 1 went out with a BANG!

Super satisfying reveals and the stage is set perfectly.,"The irony of Galadriel helping Sauron to execute his masterful plan is super satisfying. The lord of gifts and temptation is at full display. You can see the elves being enamoured by the power of his skill, melted into the rings.Great acting by the cast.The rings themselves are exquisitely beautiful and watching the craftsmanship was great.I also really enjoyed the display of magical powers by the wizard (my bet is a blue wizard rather than Gandalf) and the wraiths (Morgoth had wraiths before Sauron). That was something which was only hinted at in the films and since they were at a much later age of Arda it made sense that magic would be weaker then.Very enjoyable and great fun to be back in Middle Earth.Ignore the haters and gatekeepers - many of them know enough the be confident but not enough to be wise.",samyueldanyo,10,0.32075471698113206,Yes,Alloyed,17,53
